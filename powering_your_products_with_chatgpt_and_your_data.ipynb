      "b\"FIA Legal Department Practice Directions - Competitor's Staff Registration System\\r\\n\\r\\n17 March 2011\\r\\n\\r\\nPRACTICE DIRECTIONS\\r\\nCOMPETITOR'S STAFF REGISTRATION SYSTEM FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\\r\\nSince the FIA General Assembly of 5 November 2010, the main members of a Competitor's staff have to register with the FIA if they take part in an FIA World Championship. This system, which is based on disciplinary and safety considerations, is part of the FIA International Sporting Code (herein referred to as the `ISC').\\r\\nThe objective of this system is to preserve and protect the FIA Formula One World Championship by depriving, temporarily or definitively, any duly registered member of a Competitor's staff guilty of conduct contrary to the FIA Code of Good Standing of the right to access the Reserved Areas at events forming part of any FIA World Championship (see Article 30bis of the ISC).\\r\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\r\\nThese Practice Directions have been introduced by the FIA to clarify certain aspects of the new system of certificate of registration for the staff of Competitors entered in the FIA Formula One World Championship and the way in which the FIA intends to implement the system with regard to the FIA Formula One World Championship.\\r\\nHowever, these Practice Directions do not amend the ISC or the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules in any way. Nor do these Practice Directions limit the discretion of the FIA International Tribunal (herein referred to as `IT') or the FIA International Court of Appeal (herein referred to as `ICA').\\r\\nThese Practice Directions will be made available on the FIA website and that in relation to, and at the time of, any determination being made by the IT or the ICA the FIA will submit a copy of these Practice Directions to the applicable FIA court.\\r\\nII. REGISTERED MEMBERS OF COMPETITOR' STAFF\\r\\nA minimum of 6 persons shall in principle be registered per Competitor:\\r\\n Team Principal: the competitor's most important decision-maker;  Sporting Director: ensures the compliance of the Competitor with the sporting regulations;  Technical Director: ensures the compliance of the Competitor with the technical regulations;  Team Manager: holds the operational responsibility of the Competitor at the events;  2 Race Engineers responsible for the Competitor's cars.\\r\\nThe name of a member of staff may appear in two places on the Competitor registration form, on condition that the relevant Competitor justifies to the satisfaction of the FIA, by producing its organisational chart, that the individual concerned is indeed performing these two sets of duties. In that event an individual would only need one registration.\\r\\n1 / 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cFIA Legal Department Practice Directions - Competitor's Staff Registration System\\r\\n\\r\\n17 March 2011\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. REGISTRATION PROCESS\\r\\nIn the FIA World Championships, it is the responsibility of the Competitors to communicate to the FIA the list of the members of their staff who are to be registered as Competitor's Staff.\\r\\nEach duly registered member of a Competitor's staff will be given, via the Competitor, a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration with the FIA (see Appendix 4), a document that is drawn up and issued by the FIA and that remains the property of the FIA.\\r\\n(i) Entry closing date: When applying to enter an FIA World Championship, the Competitor must communicate to the FIA the list of the members of their staff who are to be registered as Competitor's Staff by providing the FIA with the form drawn up specifically for that purpose (see Appendix 4), duly signed and completed.\\r\\n(ii) Renewal date: 1st of January of each year\\r\\n(iii) Modification of the list of members of the staff: The Competitor must inform the FIA of this within the 7 days following that change and submit an updated list within the same deadline, while returning to the FIA the Competitor's Staff Certificates of Registration of the persons who have ceased to perform their role.\\r\\nThe FIA will follow the same procedure for applications during the course of a season as that applicable for annual applications.\\r\\nThe FIA will not charge a fee for issuing or renewing a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration.\\r\\nIV. REFUSAL TO ISSUE A COMPETITOR'S STAFF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION (see applicable procedure in Appendix 1)\\r\\nThe FIA reserves the right to refuse to issue a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration to any person who is under a disciplinary sanction imposed by the IT and/or the ICA or is in breach of the FIA Code of Good Standing (see Appendix B to the ISC).\\r\\nIf the FIA, after having received an application for a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration, intends to refuse to grant a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration, it will, within 8 days after the receipt of such application, inform the relevant person and Competitor of such proposed refusal, giving its written detailed reasons, and then give the person and the Competitor an opportunity to make representations to it in writing (including by email) regarding such refusal within 8 days after having received notification of the intended refusal.\\r\\nIf the FIA, having duly considered any representations made by the relevant person and/or the Competitor, still intends to refuse to grant a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration, it may then, not later than 8 days after receiving any such representations, or, if no such representations are made, after the last date for receiving any such representations, make a decision to the effect that the Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration should not be granted (herein referred to as `Refusal Decision') and in that event forthwith inform the relevant person and Competitor in writing of the Refusal Decision.\\r\\nAny Refusal Decision of the FIA may be appealed by the relevant person to the ICA in accordance with the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules.\\r\\nWith regard to the refusal to issue a competitor's staff certificate of registration, the FIA will use its best endeavours to procure that the ICA will hear and decide on any appeal prior to the beginning of the season (not applicable for applications during the course of a season).\\r\\nIf the ICA overturns the Refusal Decision, the Refusal Decision shall cease to have any effect and the FIA shall forthwith proceed to grant the Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration to the relevant person.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 / 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cFIA Legal Department Practice Directions - Competitor's Staff Registration System\\r\\n\\r\\n17 March 2011\\r\\n\\r\\nV. WITHDRAWAL AND SUSPENSION OF A COMPETITOR'S STAFF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION\\r\\nThe FIA will have regard at all times to the materiality of the breach and safety considerations.\\r\\nFIA administrative and disciplinary proceedings are subject to the French law, and in particular to the principle of proportionality and the free speech principle.\\r\\n(i) Exercise of the disciplinary power by the FIA: (see Appendix 2, item 1)\\r\\nAccording to the new FIA disciplinary system (see Appendix 3), the President of the FIA, in his capacity as prosecuting body, may take the matter before the IT in accordance with the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules.\\r\\nThe IT will, therefore, be competent to establish the existence, or not, of a breach of the FIA regulations and to impose any sanction upon the person and Competitor concerned (see the process governed by the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules).\\r\\nThe President of the FIA, in its capacity as prosecuting authority, will ask, in respect of every disciplinary procedure:\\r\\n- for the imposition of a suspension upon Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration holders who have contravened the FIA Code of Good Standing or the withdrawal of the Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration (any withdrawal can only be imposed for the remaining period of the current season of the FIA Formula One World Championship); and\\r\\n- that these same people not be fined.\\r\\nThe person and/or Competitor sanctioned may bring an appeal before the ICA against the IT's decision.\\r\\n*********\\r\\nThe FIA will inform the relevant Competitor of any proceedings instigated against any member of its staff. It is the responsibility to the relevant Competitor to send the IT a written request to be heard, and if granted, it shall be permitted to submit written observations. The FIA undertakes to support before the IT and/or the ICA any request from the Competitor to intervene as a third party within the framework of a disciplinary procedure.\\r\\nThe right to deprive any duly registered member of a Competitor's staff of access to the Reserved Areas at events forming part of the FIA Formula One World Championship is subject to the procedure set forth in the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules.\\r\\nThe Stewards during the course of an Event or otherwise will have no authority to suspend or withdraw a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration for any breach or alleged breach of the FIA Code of Good Standing.\\r\\n(ii) Provisional Suspension: (see Appendix 2, item 2)\\r\\nIn an emergency and where there are exceptional circumstances (which the FIA has the burden of establishing), the FIA has the right to suspend provisionally a Competitor's Staff Certificate of Registration in accordance with Article 12 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules:\\r\\n If the protection of the participants in an event organised under the aegis of the FIA so requires, for reasons of public order or in the interest of motor sport, the IT may, at the request of the President of the FIA, provisionally suspend in particular any authorisation, licence or approval issued by the FIA, within the framework of a race, competition or other event organised by the FIA. This measure cannot exceed a period of three months, renewable once.\\r\\n3 / 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cFIA Legal Department Practice Directions - Competitor's Staff Registration System\\r\\n\\r\\n17 March 2011\\r\\n\\r\\n The measure of provisional suspension cannot be pronounced unless the person accused has been heard by the IT, or summoned at least 10 days in advance, unless circumstances are such that it is necessary to shorten this time limit.\\r\\n Unless otherwise stated, the proceedings for hearings under this Article 12 shall be the same for hearings under Article 11.\\r\\n Provisional suspension, in particular of any authorisation, licence or approval issued on behalf of or by the FIA, is not a disciplinary sanction but a safety measure implemented for the protection of persons, public order or the interest of motor sport. It does not prevent a disciplinary procedure from being instigated, if applicable, for the purpose of imposing sanctions for the same acts.\\r\\n The person whose provisional suspension is under consideration is summoned to a hearing of the IT, convened in an extraordinary meeting as a matter of urgency. This summons contains the factual and legal justification for the hearing, and informs the person concerned that he has a period of 8 days to submit his observations, that he may be assisted by the lawyer of his choice, and that if he fails to appear a decision will be taken on the sole basis of the dossier enclosed with the summons. The documents justifying the envisaged measure of suspension are appended to the summons.\\r\\nThe FIA will forthwith inform the relevant Competitor of such proceedings. It is the responsibility to the relevant Competitor to send the IT a written request to be heard, and if granted, it shall be permitted to submit written observations. The FIA undertakes to support before the IT and/or the ICA any request from the Competitor to intervene as a third party within the framework of this procedure.\\r\\n The decision of suspension is fully enforceable as soon as it has been pronounced, and an appeal before the ICA does not suspend the enforcement of this sanction.\\r\\n The person who has had his authorisation, licence or approval provisionally suspended must abstain from any act that is liable to circumvent the measure of suspension.\\r\\n The person who is the subject of a provisional suspension may bring an appeal before the ICA.\\r\\nIf the ICA overturns the IT's decision, the IT's decision shall cease to have any effect.\\r\\n The President of the FIA may request that the IT put an end to the provisional suspension at any time, either on his own initiative or at the request of the party concerned, unless the measure has been confirmed by the ICA.\\r\\nVI. OBLIGATIONS OF THE REGISTERED MEMBERS OF THE COMPETITOR'S STAFF\\r\\nThe registered members of the Competitor's staff must observe the FIA Code of Good Standing.\\r\\nThe following sets out examples of the type of behaviours which might constitute an infringement of the FIA Code of Good Standing (non-exhaustive list of examples) in relation to a person who is subject to the Code of Good Standing:\\r\\n- giving instructions to a driver or other member of a Competitor's staff with the intention or with the likely result of causing an accident, collision or crash or a race to be stopped or suspended;\\r\\n- any action which is likely to endanger or materially compromise the safety of any driver, other members of the Competitor's staff, other participants in a race, Officials or any spectators or other members of the public who attend an event;\\r\\n- giving instructions to make any changes to a car in breach of any safety requirements or regulations;\\r\\n- giving instructions to tamper with or adversely affect the set-up or performance of the car of any other Competitor;\\r\\n4 / 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cFIA Legal Department Practice Directions - Competitor's Staff Registration System\\r\\n\\r\\n17 March 2011\\r\\n\\r\\n- giving instructions to a driver or otherwise taking any action by which the result or course of a race may be influenced or affected for the purpose of profiting or assisting someone to profit through betting on the outcome of a race or any part of a race; or\\r\\n- being convicted of a criminal offence (other than a driving offence) which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.\\r\\nVII.

However, if the driver retires from the sprint session or the race as a result of the car being released in an unsafe condition a fine may be imposed upon the Competitor.\\r\\ne) An additional penalty will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, continues to drive a car knowing it to have been released in an unsafe condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n38/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c34.15 In exceptional circumstances the Race Director may ask for the pit entry to be closed during the sprint session or the race for safety reasons.\\r\\na) At such times drivers may only enter the pit lane in order for essential and entirely evident repairs to be carried out to the car.\\r\\nb) A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, entered the pit lane for any other reason whilst it was closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n35) WEIGHING 35.1 After any free practice session or during the qualifying practice session cars will be\\r\\nweighed as follows:\\r\\na) When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his engine.\\r\\nb) Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage, will be referred to the stewards.\\r\\nc) Each driver must be weighed by the Technical Delegate at the end of the last part of the qualifying practice session in which they participated.\\r\\nd) At the end of the qualifying practice session all cars which took part in Q3 will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.\\r\\ne) If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying practice session and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to the pit lane in order for his weight to be established.\\r\\n35.2 After the sprint session or the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.\\r\\n35.3 The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1 of the Technical Regulations when weighed in accordance with Articles 35.1 or 35.2, save where the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car.\\r\\n35.4 No substance may be added to, placed on, or removed from a car after it has been selected for weighing or has finished the sprint session or the race or during the weighing procedure. (Except by a scrutineer when acting in his official capacity).\\r\\n35.5 In the event of any breach of these provisions for the weighing of cars the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate or disqualify him from the sprint session or the race.\\r\\n\\r\\n36) REFUELLING 36.1 Refuelling is only permitted in the Competitors\\' designated garages.\\r\\n36.2 Fuel may not be added to nor removed from a car after it has left the pit lane to start the reconnaissance lap(s) permitted in accordance with Articles 43.2 or 44.1 until the endof-session signal has been shown in accordance with Article 59.1.\\r\\n36.3 No car may be refuelled, nor may fuel be removed from a car, at a rate greater than 0.8 litres per second.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n39/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c36.4 The driver may remain in his car throughout refuelling but the engine must be stopped.\\r\\n36.5 During all refuelling or fuel handling operations:\\r\\na) The relevant personnel must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with either FIA Standard 8867-2016, FIA Standard 8856-2000 or FIA Standard 8856-2018.\\r\\nb) An assistant equipped with a suitable fire extinguisher of appropriate capacity must be present and must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with either FIA Standard 8867-2016, FIA Standard 8856-2000 or FIA Standard 8856-2018.\\r\\nc) All cars, refuelling equipment and containers must be suitably grounded where necessary.\\r\\nd) Any powered pumping system used to transfer fuel must be operated by a nonlatching switch or be turned off automatically if the operator leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n37) PRACTICE SESSIONS 37.1 No driver may start a sprint session or the race without taking part in at least one (1)\\r\\npractice session.\\r\\n37.2 During all practice sessions there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars may only leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light will be shown in the pit exit to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are approaching on the track.\\r\\n37.3 Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be used for purposes other than the Competition after the last practice session on each day of practice, after the sprint session (where it is scheduled), and on the day of the race no less than one (1) hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to allow cars to cover a reconnaissance lap.\\r\\n37.4 In the event of a driving infringement during any practice session the Stewards may delete a driver\\'s lap time (or lap times) or drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate.\\r\\na) Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any such incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session.\\r\\nb) Where appropriate, regard will also be given to the provisions of Article 18.1.\\r\\n37.5 Any driver taking part in any practice session who, in the opinion of the stewards, stops unnecessarily on the circuit or unnecessarily impedes another driver shall be subject to the penalties referred to in Article 37.4.\\r\\n37.6 Should it become necessary to stop any practice session because the circuit is blocked by an accident or because weather or other conditions make it dangerous to continue, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at the Line.\\r\\na) When the signal is given to stop all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which the \"RED FLAG\" message appears on the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n40/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cb) All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place.\\r\\nc) At the end of each practice session no driver may cross the Line more than once.\\r\\n37.7 The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during qualifying practice will the session be extended as a result.\\r\\na) Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the possible effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start.\\r\\n38) FREE PRACTICE 38.1 At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled:\\r\\na) One (1) free practice session (P1), lasting one (1) hour will take place on the first day of on track running.\\r\\nb) A further free practice session (P2), lasting one (1) hour and starting no less than three (3) hours after the time that seals and covers may be removed, and ending no less than three (3) hours and no more than four (4) hours prior to the start of the sprint session will take place the day before the race.\\r\\n38.2 At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled:\\r\\na) Two (2) free practice sessions (P1 and P2), each lasting one (1) hour and separated by no less than two (2) hours and no more than three (3) hours, take place on the first day of on track running.\\r\\ni) Within three (3) hours of the end of the second free practice session (P2) all cars used during each session (or which were intended for use but failed to leave the pit lane) must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied in order to ensure that they remain secure until the following day. Failure to comply with this requirement will be equivalent to a breach of Article 23.7 h) and failure to comply with both Articles will be considered as a single breach.\\r\\nii) Whilst cars are covered overnight, they may be fitted with devices to keep them warm.\\r\\niii) For the purpose of this Article 38.2 only, a car is defined as consisting of all the components required to comply with the Technical Regulations with the exception of the Floor, the nose, the Front Wing and the Rear Wing as detailed in Articles 3.5, 3.6.1, 3.9 and 3.10 of the Technical Regulations respectively.

Any Power Unit Manufacturer wishing to supply power units to a Competitor must fulfil the obligations set out in section 1.1 of Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations.\\r\\nb. No power unit may be used in a given Championship season unless the Power Unit Manufacturer supplying such power unit accepts and adheres to the following conditions.\\r\\nEach of the Power Unit Manufacturers of an homologated power unit must:\\r\\n1. provide the FIA, before 15 May (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power units are to be supplied, with the list of teams (clearly identifying the appointed \"works/factory\" team, if any) to which a supply agreement has been concluded for the given Championship season;\\r\\n2. if called upon to do so by the FIA before 1 June (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power units were to be supplied, supply at least a number of teams (\"T\") equal to the following equation:\\r\\nT = (111-A)/(B-C)\\r\\n- A = Total number of teams (including \"works/factory\" teams) having a supply agreement concluded for the given Championship season with a New Power Unit Manufacturer.\\r\\n- B = Total number of manufacturers of homologated Power Units for the given Championship season.\\r\\n- C = Total number of New Power Unit Manufacturers for the given Championship season.\\r\\nprovided that if the result contains a fraction then the fraction shall count as a full team (e.g. 11 teams divided by 4 manufacturers = 2.75, each manufacturer must, if called upon to do so by the FIA, supply at least 3 teams).\\r\\n1 This figure will be reviewed each year as the \"total number of entered teams\" will not be known until November preceding the Championship season. The figure of 11 covers supply of 12 teams or less in compliance with the calculation rule.\\r\\nIn doing so, the FIA will first allocate the power unit supply between the Power Unit Manufacturers that are supplying the fewest number of teams, provided that the teams without a supply agreement shall be allocated to the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) that supplies(supply) the lowest number of teams and so on. If there is more than one Power Unit Manufacturer supplying the fewest number of teams (i.e. in the same position) and/or more than one team requesting a supply the allocation between such Power Unit Manufacturers shall occur by ballot (which ballot shall be transparent and undertaken by the FIA in the\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n80/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cpresence of a representative of each of the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) and the new Customer Team concerned).\\r\\nAny such allocation made by the FIA will have to be formalised by a supply agreement with the concerned team by 1 August at the latest (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA).\\r\\nA New Power Unit Manufacturer will not be required to comply with this obligation of supply as set out above.\\r\\nc. The FIA shall be entitled to request a Power Unit Manufacturer to supply a team (\"New Customer Team\") with a power unit under the terms of this Appendix except if, at the date set out in Article b) i) above:\\r\\n- Such team has entered into a supply agreement with a Power Unit Manufacturer for a given Championship season before the date set out in Article b) i) above, and\\r\\n- Such team has been granted a right, under a currently binding offer with a Power Unit Manufacturer, to be supplied with a power unit for such given Championship season.\\r\\nMoreover, such Power Unit Manufacturer shall only be required to supply a New Customer Team if the following cumulative conditions are met. If such conditions are not met, then the Power Unit Manufacturer may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, decline the request to supply such New Customer Team and the decline of such request shall not be deemed to be a breach of the terms set out in this Appendix (however Article c) cannot be applied or interpreted by the Power Unit Manufacturer in a way which would deprive the obligation of supply as referred to in Article b) above of any effect and/or that would prevent the FIA from making and enforcing the provisions set out in Article b) above. The Power Unit Manufacturer undertakes to exercise in good faith the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 to 11 below). The teams and the Power Unit Manufacturers remain free to negotiate the terms of the supply agreement, subject to the fall-back positions set out below which shall apply should a team and a Power Unit Manufacturer fail to reach an agreement, despite negotiating in good faith.\\r\\n1. For the purpose of this paragraph, supply contract only refers to the contract related to the FIA Supply Perimeter as per the Sporting and Technical Regulations and as set out in the relevant column of the first table in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations.\\r\\n1.1. Any supply contract entered into with the New Customer Team must be on substantially the same terms as those entered into between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the other customer teams (other than its appointed \"works/factory\" team) to whom it already supplies a power unit at the date of the FIA request (\"Existing Customer Team\"), other than the Price as referred to in paragraph 8 below. In particular, the Power Unit Manufacturer may impose and the team cannot refuse to sign up to any terms which at least one of its other Existing Customer Teams has agreed to and the Power Unit Manufacturer may refuse and the team cannot request the inclusion of terms which are not included in the supply agreements with other Existing Customer Teams.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n81/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c1.2. In the event that a Power Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any other Existing Customer Team, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall have the right to decide, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the payment terms and conditions (including the price of additional goods and services not included in the supply perimeter designated `EXC\\' in the relevant column of the first table in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations, but excluding the Price which shall be determined in compliance with the definition of Price below) applicable to the New Customer Team subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 below.\\r\\n1.3. In case of a dispute about the application or the interpretation of paragraph 1 hereto, the FIA will be entitled to request copies of the contracts being entered into by the Power Unit Manufacturer with any customer team, provided that such contracts are not disclosed to any new Customer Team and subject to the FIA agreeing to comply with strict customary confidentiality obligations.\\r\\n2. The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the duration of the term of the power unit supply which:\\r\\n2.1. may not be lower than one Championship season; and\\r\\n2.2. shall not exceed three Championship seasons nor go beyond the end of the 2025 Championship season, unless jointly agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team\\r\\n3. The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, whether the New Customer Team shall use the name of the Power Unit Manufacturer or the New Customer Team shall operate under a white label/unbranded way and, for this purpose, use a different name:\\r\\n3.1. The use of this different name shall always be agreed in advance by the Power Unit Manufacturer, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; and\\r\\n3.2. In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is required without being requested by the New Customer Team, this supply will not incur additional fees for the New Customer Team except if the use of the power unit name leads to the conclusion of a commercial agreement between the New Customer Team and any third party. In that case, the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall commonly agree on the fair and reasonable part of the revenues generated by the commercial agreement which could be considered as additional fees;\\r\\n3.3. In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is requested by the New Customer Team and agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer, this supply may incur additional fees for the New Customer Team, such fees being determined at the sole and exclusive discretion of the Power Unit Manufacturer in a fair and reasonable manner.\\r\\n4. The New Customer Team shall provide a warranty that it has no binding contracts or option(s) in place with another power unit manufacturer for future supply of power\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n82/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cunits. The New Customer Team shall be required to terminate any such contracts or option(s) which do exist in so far as they conflict with any part of the period of the contract being entered into with the Power Unit Manufacturer.\\r\\n5. The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) be an Automotive Manufacturer or any of its affiliated companies which has been set up with the purpose amongst other things of participating in the Championship.\\r\\n6. The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) have any sponsorship agreement in place with any entity, which is in competition with the Core Activities of an Automotive Manufacturer which are carried out by the Power Unit Manufacturer.\\r\\n7. The New Customer Team and/or any senior executives, directors or beneficial shareholders of the New Customer Team should not at any time (i) be listed or included in the official EU and/or US published sanction lists; (ii) have been convicted of any indictable criminal offence; (iii) have been convicted by any government or government agency in connection with fraud, money laundering, racketeering or terrorism activities; and/or (iv) have been declared bankrupt; and/or (v) have committed other identified action which, in the reasonable opinion of the Power Unit Manufacturer, harms the reputation of such Power Unit Manufacturer. This clause shall also reciprocally apply to the Power Unit Manufacturer.\\r\\n8. The Power Unit Supply Perimeter listed in the relevant column of the first table in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations and designated `INC\\' shall be supplied to New Customer Teams at the Price.\\r\\nThe supply of additional goods or services not listed in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations (which shall be agreed between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) shall incur additional charges, the amount of which shall be substantially the same as that applied by the Power Unit Manufacturer to its Existing Customer Team. In the event that a Power Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any other Existing Customer Team, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall decide the price of the above-mentioned additional goods and services based on the usages and practices generally recognised and respected in the market for the supply of parts and services in the Championship.\\r\\n9. The FIA shall confirm in writing to the Power Unit Manufacturer that, to the best of its knowledge, the New Customer Team, including its officers, directors and beneficial shareholders, has not been convicted of non-complying at all times with the FIA Code of Good Standing.\\r\\n10. Payment of the fees (directly or indirectly through a payment guarantee) under the supply contract for each season shall as a fall-back position (unless otherwise agreed between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) and, notwithstanding the terms of any contract with an Existing Customer Team or its own factory team, be made in four instalments:\\r\\n- 25% on the date of signature of the supply contract;\\r\\n- 25% on or before 30 October of the calendar year prior to the year of supply;\\r\\n- 30% before the start of the Championship season; and\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n83/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c- The remaining 20% before the fifth Formula One Competition of the Championship.\\r\\n10.1. In case of any delayed payment for an amount greater than 100,000, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall send the New Customer Team a written notice of the breach, with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should the New Customer Team fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the Power Unit Manufacturer (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the Power Unit Manufacturer shall be entitled to either terminate the supply contract immediately by serving written notice on the New Customer Team, with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder, or, suspend delivery of the power units to the New Customer Team.\\r\\n10.2. In case of breach of the obligation to deliver the power units and/or to supply additional goods or services to the New Customer Team pursuant to the supply agreement, such New Customer Team may send the Power Unit Manufacturer a written notice of the breach (but only in the event that the New Customer Team is not itself in breach of contract including for nonpayment except if that non-payment is justified by an alleged breach of the supply contract by the Power Unit Manufacturer), with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should the Power Unit Manufacturer fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the New Customer Team (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the New Customer Team shall be entitled to suspend payment of the fees to the Power Unit Manufacturer.\\r\\n11. The New Customer Team and the Power Unit Manufacturer shall not, and will procure its affiliates and/or their respective senior executives, employees, directors and shareholders shall not take any action and/or make any omission, deceptive, misleading or disparaging or negative comments, which directly injures, damages or brings into disrepute the public reputation, goodwill or favourable name or image of the other party to the supply agreement.\\r\\nd. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.3 of the Sporting Regulations, unless agreed otherwise by the FIA, each of the manufacturers of an homologated power unit may not directly or indirectly supply power units for more than (T+1) teams, with T as defined in Article b). Such consent shall not be given if one or more of the other Power Unit Manufacturers are supplying less that T teams.\\r\\ne. Ceasing the supply of the power units.\\r\\nAny manufacturer of a homologated power unit wishing to cease the supply of power units must notify the FIA of its intention to do so no later than 1 January of the year preceding that in which such power units will no longer be supplied.\\r\\nf. In case of any alleged material breach or alleged material failure to comply with any of the obligations of the present Appendix, the FIA shall engage good faith and active discussions with the Power Unit Manufacturer and, in the absence of amicable solution within one month, be entitled to engage proceedings before the FIA International Tribunal against the Power Unit Manufacturer.

Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of a Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor in a test environment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or sub-component in order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, pressures or air flow direction resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow.\\r\\nb. A three-dimensional representation of an F1 car or sub-component subject to Restricted Aerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be considered for the purposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test Geometry (RATG) and save for where specifically permitted by this Article may not be added to, removed from, morphed or modified. In order to prevent Restricted Aerodynamic testing methodologies intended to subvert any limits on the number or nature of RATGs permitted under the ATR the following will apply:\\r\\ni. The purpose of a RATG is to allow aerodynamic assessment of a single new geometry, with aerodynamic dependency maintained throughout the simulated flow field. Any attempt to derive aerodynamically independent results for subcomponents of a RATG, either in the initial simulation or test, or by subsequent modification to the simulation or test conditions, is not permitted. Any attempt to use boundary conditions or similar to infer the effect of combining RATGs, without accruing a further RATG, is also not permitted. The use of boundary conditions cannot be exploited to simulate the effect on the fluid of a geometry which is different from the RATG in use.\\r\\nii. If the representation contains external bodywork surfaces on both sides of the centre plane of the car these must be symmetrical about this plane with the exception of the wheel bodywork defined by Article 3.13 of the Technical Regulations. Minimal exceptions for parts directly associated with the cooling of the power unit, or changes of car attitude allowed under section 3d (roll and steer) will be permitted.\\r\\niii. Excluding permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, the substitution or replacement of any part of a RATG with a non-F1 car geometry, or the placement of any physical or computational boundary condition or solver setting, that simulates or attempts to simulate a modification to this RATG will be considered as a new RATG.\\r\\niv. Sections (or sub-models) of a RATG which is used for RCFDs may be created by removing geometry from the parent RATG and placing boundary\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n86/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cconditions of velocity or pressure profiles generated entirely from the same RATG to replicate the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been removed. This will not be considered as a new RATG provided any geometry within the section is identical to the parent RATG. Exceptionally where downstream portions of the RATG are removed these may be replaced with a single geometry approved for this purpose by the FIA.\\r\\nv. Sections (or sub-models) of a RATG used for RCFDs and created by removing geometry from a parent RATG may not be subsequently geometrically modified without being considered as a new RATG. Any boundary conditions of velocity or pressure profiles added in the process of creating the section (or sub-model) and used to replicate the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been removed may not be changed to boundary condition or profiles other than those generated from the parent RATG without being considered a new RATG.\\r\\nvi. If the representation contains surfaces that represent components of more than one F1 car then it shall be construed as the equivalent number of RATGs. Excluding permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, any subsequent modification of the relative position of the representations of F1 cars will be considered as new RATGs equivalent to the number of F1 car representations.\\r\\nvii. A baseline RATG is defined as a reference chosen from time to time that serves for comparison purposes.\\r\\nc. An Aerodynamic Testing Period (ATP) is a period of consecutive calendar weeks for the purposes of evaluation of the limits within this Article. As soon as one ATP ends a new one begins, with no gaps between them.\\r\\nThere will be 6 ATPs in any year. The dates of these periods will be as follows:\\r\\ni. Period 1 will start on 1 January and finish at the end of week 9.\\r\\nii. Periods 2, 3 and 5 will run for exactly 8 weeks each.\\r\\niii. Period 4 will run for 10 weeks, comprising the Summer Factory Shutdown described in Article 24.1.\\r\\niv. Period 6 will end on the 31 December.\\r\\nFor the above definition, weeks are assumed to start on a Monday and week 1 is the first week of four days or more in the calendar year.\\r\\nIn exceptional circumstances the FIA may revise these ATP at its absolute discretion in accordance with changes or events likely to affect these restrictions.\\r\\nd. In the context of this Article the words bodywork and sprung suspension will have the same definition as those provided by Article 3 and Article 10 of the Technical Regulations.\\r\\nAny data acquired during Restricted Aerodynamic testing may only be available to the Competitor that acquired it through use of the restricted aerodynamic testing available to it in accordance with the limits in this Article.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n87/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c2 Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT)\\r\\nRWTT may only be carried out in wind tunnels which have been nominated by the Competitor to the FIA. Each Competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in any one twelve month period and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the nomination must be made no later than 7 days after the date on which it officially becomes a Competitor. No re-nominations may be made for at least 12 months. Nominations should include the facility location, unique identification of the wind tunnel and the scale of model and RATG to be used. The FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, earlier or temporary nominations if a wind tunnel already nominated by a Competitor suffers a long term failure or for the purpose of evaluating alternative wind tunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility is changed or upgraded, other than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier.\\r\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the Competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of the Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must take place in the wind tunnel nominated by the Competitor.\\r\\na. The limits for RWTT will be the number of runs of RWTT, the amount of wind tunnel occupancy time and wind tunnel wind-on time.\\r\\ni. During RWTT a single run will be deemed to commence each time the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s and will end the first time thereafter it falls below 5m/s.\\r\\nii. During RWTT, once the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s the RATG must remain fixed and unmodified until the wind tunnel air speed returns below 1m/s.\\r\\niii. Between runs of RWTT detail changes to the RATG and model are permitted.\\r\\nb. Wind on time is defined as the amount of time in hours summed over the ATP, where the wind tunnel air speed exceeds 15m/s for RWTT.\\r\\nc. During RWTT, the first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s on a given calendar day, and will end at a time, declared by the Competitor, when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s on the same calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on the same calendar day) and will end, either when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s for the last time on the same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the event a run is still in progress. Only two shifts of occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n88/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cd. In the event of a demonstrated wind tunnel failure or other Force Majeure the FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, permitting additional occupancy to be used to compensate for that which is lost as a result.\\r\\ne. For the avoidance of doubt any RWTT performed for the Competitor by any Associate of the Competitor and/or by any contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of the Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to the Competitor during an ATP will be subject to these same limits as if the tests were performed by the Competitor.\\r\\n3 RWTT Permitted technology\\r\\nThe following restrictions apply during RWTT:\\r\\na. Only wind tunnels that use air at atmospheric pressure as the test fluid are permitted. Other than rotations of the RATG and model or ground plane about the yaw axis, designs which attempt to create curved flow conditions relative to the RATG are not permitted. For closed section wind tunnels adaption of vertical walls and the ceiling to improve air flow uniformity is permitted.\\r\\nb. No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than 60% of full size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding 50m/s measured relative to the scale model and RATG. Furthermore, during restricted wind tunnel testing the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed measured relative to the scale model and RATG must be less than 4.5m/s\\xef\\xbf\\xbd. The rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed will be defined as the derivative of wind tunnel air speed and smoothed using a moving average filter, centred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds during each wind tunnel air speed ramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are defined as the periods when the wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% of the maximum wind tunnel air speed during a run.\\r\\nc. Only one model and RATG may be used per run. A maximum of two models may be used and a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For the avoidance of doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, motors and sensors.\\r\\nd. The only permitted degrees of freedom of the model and RATG during a run of RWTT are:\\r\\ni. Wheel rotation about the wheel axis\\r\\nii. Changes of ride height and roll angle relative to the ground plane and associated articulation of the elements representing the RATG suspension\\r\\niii. Changes of load applied to wheels through the elements representing the RATG suspension\\r\\niv. Steering of the front wheels\\r\\nv. Changes of yaw angle relative to the incident air flow and/or ground plane\\r\\nvi. Simulation of differing exhaust flow\\r\\nvii. Adjustment of the flap angle of the front wing\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n89/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cviii. Adjustment of the incidence of the rearmost and uppermost element of the top rear wing\\r\\nix. Adjustment or operation of sensors\\r\\ne. Changes of attitude of the model and RATG may not occur at a rate that requires changes of ride height at the front or rear axle centreline greater than the scale equivalent of 0.033 m/s on the full size F1 car and/or rotation about the yaw or roll axes at a rate greater than 1.0 deg./s.\\r\\nf. Where non-rigid wind tunnel tyres are used for RWTT these may only be produced by the appointed tyre supplier. Furthermore, devices that actively modify the shape of the tyre during RWTT other than as a result of vertical and lateral loads reacted at the contact patch are not permitted. Tyre pressure control is permitted but the complete wheel must contain only a single fixed internal gas volume.\\r\\n4 Restricted CFD (RCFD) simulations\\r\\nRCFDs are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by a Competitor or any Associate of a Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor of flows that are gaseous in the case of a F1 car and are not classified as power unit simulations. Any simulation of flows contained within the power unit cooling or lubrication systems, air, air/fuel mixtures, combustion process or products of combustion from a boundary commencing at the power unit\\'s atmospheric air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will be classified as a power unit simulation.\\r\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if any CFD simulation (other than the power unit simulation defined above) reveals information to a Competitor or to an Associate of the Competitor whether directly, via a contracted party or via an external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor, about flows that are gaseous on a F1 car then it is a RCFD simulation. For example, any CFD simulations conducted at scales other than 1:1 or using non-gaseous fluids are still RCFDs as they reveal information about flows that are gaseous on the full size F1 car.\\r\\na. A RCFDs refers to the pre-processing, the solver part or parts of the simulation process, and the post processing of the results of the simulation.\\r\\ni. Pre-processing refers to the meshing, decomposition and setup of the simulation.\\r\\nii. Solver refers to the program or programs that compute the solution of the equations describing the flow including any extension of the simulation or simulations involving additional numerical computation (for example but not limited, to adjoint computation).\\r\\niii. Post processing refers to the generation of representations of the flow solution that require numerical processing, for example but not limited to the computation of pressure coefficients, velocity, shear stress, flow streamlines or vorticity. Generation of videos or images displaying this information and\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n90/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cany form or application of machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) based on simulation results is included in this definition.\\r\\nDuring or prior to RCFDs the only permitted changes to the RATG are its attitude (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence. For avoidance of doubt, should any other changes be made to the RATG during any stage or pause in process ii. above (such as a morphing, or the addition or substitution of any boundary condition with the intent to replicate an alternative geometry) a new RATG must be counted each time a change occurs.\\r\\nChanges to parts classified as LTC, TRC or OSC and contained entirely within the drum volume defined by article 3.13.2 and the scoop defined by article 3.13.3 of the Technical Regulations and outboard of YW=0 and only for the purpose of developing cooling are permitted.\\r\\nModifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type provided they have the purpose of resolving and solving exactly the same geometry to a tolerance of 0.5mm scaled to a 1:1 car, as well as the extent of the far field domain, changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track environment, initialisation, boundary conditions, solver settings and methodology are allowed. None of these modifications may be exploited to circumvent the requirements of the ATR by otherwise creating the effect of a change to the RATG. For the purposes of the ATR \"far field\" will be considered to be greater than 1m from any part of the F1 car or sub-component scaled to a 1:1 car.\\r\\nA RATG may be used in RCFDs with geometry on only one side of the car centre plane, using a symmetric boundary condition on that plane, or with geometry on both sides of the car centre plane, subject to the geometric symmetry requirements of section 1.b.ii. Changing between these two representations will not be considered a new RATG.\\r\\nThe addition of non-gaseous computational regions (including but not limited to coupled structural solver elements and conjugate heat transfer solid models) are not considered changes to the RATG provided that no geometric changes to the RATG itself take place during or prior to RCFDs.\\r\\nThe solver part or parts of all RCFDs must only be carried out using a compute resource that contains a set of homogeneous processing units and that has been nominated by the Competitor to the FIA. Each Competitor must declare to the FIA in writing the compute resources that are employed for the purpose of the solver part or parts of RCFD simulations. Floating, fixed point and integer operations from the solver part or parts of RCFD simulations must only run on and may not be offloaded from these CPU cores.\\r\\nb. The declaration of a compute resource by the Competitor to the FIA must include:\\r\\ni. The computer or cluster identification, manufacturer, model and location and the manufacturer, name and full unique model number of the Processing Units.\\r\\nii. Number of processing unit cores in the compute resource.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n91/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0ciii. Processor speed at which each Processing Unit is configured to run at 100% CPU load (CCF). In order to prevent deliberate underclocking this value may not be lower than the standard or base clock frequency given by the Manufacturer\\'s specification.\\r\\nAny specification of compute resource declared must be available on a nonexclusive basis to all Competitors.\\r\\nc. If the compute resource is changed or upgraded then a new declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier. Such changes might include, but are not limited to, a change of the hardware specification, addition or removal of processing units or change of location of any part of the compute resource.\\r\\nd. The amount of compute resource used for the solve part or parts of all RCFDs shall be measured in Mega Allocation Unit hours (MAUh) and will be calculated as follows.\\r\\nAUh = (NCU * NSS * CCF) / 3600\\r\\nWhere:\\r\\nAUh = The total number of Unit hours allocated to a CFD solver run. An Allocation Unit hour represents the use of a unit of resource allocation for one hour (and 1 x MAUh = 1,000,000 x AUh). An Allocation Unit hour is equivalent to a core hour on a physical CPU core.\\r\\nCCF = Peak Processing Unit clock frequency in GigaHertz achieved during the CFD solver run. This will be the peak frequency theoretically achievable during the run based on one of the following:\\r\\ni) The standard or base clock frequency value from the Processing Unit Manufacturer\\'s specification (if overclocking or enhanced modes are not used in the run).\\r\\nii) The maximum \"turbo\", \"HPC\" or other enhanced mode frequency value.\\r\\niii) The maximum overclocked frequency value.\\r\\nNCU = Number of Processing Unit cores used for the solver run. The effects of multi-threading, where simultaneous threads run on the same physical core will be ignored.\\r\\nNSS = Number of solver wall clock seconds elapsed during the run. Message passing time during calculation must also be included.\\r\\nAll information required for auditing of this calculation must be present in the output from the run including the CCF value.\\r\\ne. Non-RCFDs can be made by a Competitor provided that:\\r\\ni. They use a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months ago and are for the purpose of optimising CFD methodology; or\\r\\nii. They use an FIA approved CAD geometry provided to all Competitors on an equitable and transparent basis and are for the purpose of optimising CFD methodology; or\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n92/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0ciii. Subject to iv. and for the sole purpose of contributing toward the development of future regulations only, they use an FIA approved geometry provided for this purpose or as a basis for modification a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD less than 30 months ago.\\r\\niv. Non-RCFDs for future regulations are conditional on the full list and details of all such Non-RCFDs (including but not limited to geometries, attitudes, flow conditions) being approved by the FIA in advance of any work being carried out and full reports of the results being made available to all Competitors, via the FIA, with no team-specific Intellectual Property shared.\\r\\nv. They are carried out using only the nominated compute resources described above.\\r\\nvi. The unique RATG or FIA approved geometry is not changed, added to, removed from, morphed or modified. Exceptions to this are permitted for the replacement of elements of the RATG or FIA approved geometry, with boundary conditions for the purposes of developing CFD sub-modelling methodology provided it does not attempt to simulate a modification to this RATG or FIA approved geometry, or where geometry changes are explicitly permitted and pre-approved by the FIA for the development of future regulations.\\r\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any Non-RCFDs carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the Competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of the Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must also be carried out using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD by the Competitor more than 30 months ago or an FIA approved geometry.\\r\\nf. In the case of Non-RCFDs using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months ago or Non-RCFDs using an FIA approved geometry, geometry manipulations (e.g. in CAD clean-up or meshing software) having the sole purpose of reproducing exactly the same geometry previously solved in CFD or represented in the FIA approved CAD model or list (to a tolerance of 1.5mm scaled to a 1:1 car) are allowed. This tolerance is introduced only to allow for unintentional and incidental changes in geometry detail caused by the revisions in software and process. For the avoidance of doubt, static changes to car attitude (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence are permitted. Furthermore, when using an FIA approved geometry the FIA may approve additional incidence changes to bodywork (\"active aerodynamics\") which will be clearly identified within the FIA approved CAD files and associated documentation.\\r\\ng. Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type as well as the extent of the far field domain including changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track environment, are allowed.\\r\\nh. The limits for RCFDs will be revised periodically, to take account of advances in CFD simulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n93/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c5 Exceptions to the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR)\\r\\na. Any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car at any Competition or any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car during and at track testing as defined by Article 10 of the Sporting Regulations will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing.\\r\\nb. Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of power unit heat exchangers that reject heat to air, or the running of the power unit from a boundary commencing at the power unit air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing, provided that there is no direct or indirect measurement of aerodynamic force during the test. In this context, pressure and flow measurements within a duct shall not be considered to be measurements of aerodynamic force.\\r\\nc. Steady state and dynamic engine dynamometer work with an F1 car or subcomponent will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing provided that:\\r\\ni. The bodywork used in the test has no front wing assembly as described in Article 3.9 of the Technical Regulations) or rear wing assembly (described in Article 3.10 of the Technical Regulations) present.\\r\\nii. No devices designed to measure directly, or indirectly aerodynamic forces or flow field characteristics are installed in the facility used.\\r\\niii. No sensor installed on the car or subcomponent which are capable of measuring displacements, pressures or air flow direction of the external airstream resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow may be logged. Logging files have to be available, if required, during the independent audit inspection.\\r\\niv. The gas flow exiting from the exhaust system is ducted away from the testing area before impacting on any bodywork component (other than the exhaust itself).\\r\\nd. Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of brake systems (Article 11 of the Technical Regulations), wheels and tyres (Article 10 of the Technical Regulations), and for development and calibration of pressure sensing instrumentation (such as pitot tubes, multi-directional probes and Kiel tubes), provided such tests do not concurrently test, or in any way provide incidental data or knowledge on, the performance or endurance of parts or systems classified as bodywork will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing. Parts classified as wheel bodywork may be fitted for Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of brake systems, wheels and tyres.\\r\\ne. Wind tunnel testing that uses a RATG for the sole purpose of the conditioning of wind tunnel infrastructure or the development of wind tunnel infrastructure (including all of its sub-systems such as rolling road, model motion system, force balance, wind tunnel model spine, sensors etc.) and methodology may be performed and will not count towards the accumulation of runs, wind-on time, and occupancy subject to the testing complying with either of the following restrictions:\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n94/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0ci. The front wing group and the rear wing group of the RATG must be removed from the wind tunnel for the duration of the testing or both must be fitted with bluff covers that have been approved for this purpose by the FIA. The front and rear wing groups will be considered to be bodywork described by Articles 3.9 and 3.10 of the Technical Regulations respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. A RATG is used which is more than 12 months old, or represents an FIA approved CAD geometry provided for this purpose and that no modification is made to this previously tested RATG or FIA approved geometry.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring audit Competitors may be requested to demonstrate compliance of any such testing through the production of supporting data.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any wind tunnel testing to develop bodywork parts other than as referred to above even without aerodynamic force measurement is within the definition of Restricted Aerodynamic testing.\\r\\n\\r\\n6 Limits, Reporting, Inspection and Audit\\r\\n\\r\\na. The limits for RWTT and RCFDs are as set out in the tables below where:\\r\\n\\r\\ni.

The change in ATR limits applicable to a Competitor after the start of the first ATP will be applied pro-rata according to the time remaining in the ATP during which the change occurs. At its absolute discretion and following a request from the Competitor the FIA may permit over or under use of available Restricted Aerodynamic testing in the ATP during which the change occurred to be amortised or absorbed over the subsequent ATP.\\r\\nc. In the event that the Championship order established at 30 June is subsequently changed following revisions to the results of a Competition or Competitions and therefore the limits applicable to certain Competitors change, the FIA will require Competitors to adjust Restricted Aerodynamic testing in order to comply with the revised limits from the start of the next ATP. At its absolute discretion the FIA may require or permit over or under use of available Restricted Aerodynamic testing in the ATP during which the change occurred to be amortised or absorbed before the end of the year.\\r\\nd. Each Competitor shall report to the FIA details of its RWTT and RCFDs for the preceding ATP within 14 days of the end of that ATP. The data must be provided in the exact format specified by the FIA, details of which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.\\r\\ne. Digital wind tunnel image files in colour and with sufficient unobstructed field of view of the wind tunnel working section to include the entire model must be recorded, referenced to other data collected and a copy saved including a unique time stamp to at least one second accuracy for the start of each individual run.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the FIA wish to access the images for inspection at any time they must be of adequate quality such that it is possible to use them to verify, for example, whether the front wing group (as described in Article 3.9 of the Technical Regulations) and rear wing group (as described in Article 3.10 of the Technical Regulations) are fitted. In the case of other runs deemed to be non-RWTT in the context of this Article, for example using a RATG greater than 12 months old, or using the approved wing covers, the images must also provide a clear visual reference to assist in verifying this aspect of the test.\\r\\nf. In order to permit RCFDs to continue across the end of an ATP an RATG that is used for solve or solve parts of RCFDs in an ATP may be used in any subsequent ATP subject to the requirements of Sections 1 and 4 above, without being counted again.\\r\\ng. The complete surface mesh subject to the solver part or parts of each RCFD and any non-RCFD that includes a representation of an F1 car must be recorded and stored for a period of at least 24 months or until an earlier deletion is agreed by the FIA. It must be referenced to all data relating to the RCFDs or non-RCFDs including but not limited to solution monitoring data and any boundary condition of velocity and pressure profiles applied to the far field or domain boundaries and clearly and uniquely identifiable. It must be possible from these data to verify any changes made to the RATG and identify each individual flow solution generated using it. It must be possible to trace RCFDs used to generate velocity or pressure profiles applied as boundary conditions in subsequent sections or sub-models of the RATG that have not been counted as new RATGs.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n96/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0ch. A description correct at the start of the simulation or test of each RATG that is subject to RWTT or that is counted against the maximum permitted new RATGs for RCFDs in any ATP must be recorded with a clear description such that it is possible to easily identify the nature of the changes under evaluation. These descriptions will form part of the report required by Section 6. d) above.\\r\\ni. In order to verify the Restricted Aerodynamic testing facilities employed by the Competitors and as a means of assuring common application of the restrictions set out in this Article, the FIA will arrange for independent benchmarking inspections of both wind tunnel and CFD activities to be carried out from time to time. Recommendations arising from these inspections will be incorporated into this Article.\\r\\nj. Failure to comply with the limits of the ATR by a Competitor will result in a reduction of the limits that will apply to subsequent ATP or ATPs for that Competitor at the FIA\\'s absolute discretion but by a minimum reduction equivalent to 10 multiples of the amount by which the relevant limit or limits were exceeded without prejudice to further appropriate action. (For example, if a Competitor carries out 325 restricted wind tunnel runs against a maximum of 320 in an ATP, that Competitor shall only be permitted to make 270 restricted wind tunnel runs during the next ATP).\\r\\n7 Movement of personnel\\r\\nNo Competitor may use movement of personnel involved in the development, design or testing of aerodynamic surfaces (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) with another Competitor, either directly or via an external entity, for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Article. In order that the FIA may be satisfied that any such movement of staff is compliant with this Article, each Competitor must inform the FIA of all relevant staff movements at the end of each ATP using the template which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations and must demonstrate that they have implemented all reasonable measures to avoid the disclosure of information, data or designs between the Competitors involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations \\xef\\xbf\\xbd2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n97/107\\r\\n\\r\\n19 October 2022 Issue 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX 8 POWER UNIT TEST BENCH RESTRICTIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n1 Engine dyno test limitations\\r\\na) Definitions:\\r\\n- Engine Test Bench: An Engine Test Bench is either a Power Unit Test Bench, a Power Train Test Bench or a Full Car Dyno.\\r\\n- Power Unit Test Bench: A test bench facility cell where a fired engine with more than 1 cylinder representative of a Formula One engine may be tested.

Championship\\r\\n1.1.1 The FIA will organise the FIA Formula One World Championship (the \"Championship\") which is the property of the FIA and comprises two titles of World Champion, one for drivers and one for constructors. It consists of the Formula One Grand Prix races which are included in the Formula One calendar and in respect of which the ASNs and organisers have signed organisation agreements with the FIA. All the participating parties (FIA, ASNs, organisers, competitors and circuits) undertake to apply as well as observe the rules governing the Championship and must hold FIA Super Licences which are issued to drivers, competitors, officials, organisers and circuits.\\r\\n1.1.2 The Championship and each of its Competitions are governed by the FIA in accordance with the Regulations.\\r\\n1.1.3 In the sense of the Regulations, terms referring to natural persons are applicable to any gender.\\r\\n1.2 Regulatory Framework\\r\\n1.2.1 The Regulations applicable to the Championship are the International Sporting Code (the \"Code\"), the Formula One Technical Regulations (the \"Technical Regulations\"), the Formula One Sporting Regulations (the \"Sporting Regulations\"), and the Formula One Financial Regulations (the \"Financial Regulations\"), together referred to as the \"Regulations\".\\r\\n1.2.2 These Regulations are issued by the FIA and apply to the whole calendar year referred to in the title and to the Championship taking place within that calendar year. Any changes made by the FIA for safety reasons may come into effect without notice or delay.\\r\\n1.2.3 The definitive text of the Technical Regulations shall be the English version which will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Headings in this document are for ease of reference only and do not affect the meaning of the Technical Regulations.\\r\\n1.3 Dangerous construction\\r\\nThe stewards may prohibit the participation of a vehicle whose construction is deemed to be dangerous. Should the relevant information become apparent during a session, such a decision may apply with immediate effect.\\r\\n1.4 Compliance with the regulations\\r\\nFormula 1 Cars must comply with these regulations in their entirety at all times during a Competition.\\r\\nShould a Competitor introduce a new design or system or feel that any aspect of these regulations is unclear, clarification may be sought from the FIA Formula One Technical Department. If clarification relates to any new design or system, correspondence must include:\\r\\na. A full description of the design or system.\\r\\nb. Drawings or schematics where appropriate.\\r\\nc. The Competitor\\'s opinion concerning the immediate implications on other parts of the car of any proposed new design.\\r\\nd. The Competitor\\'s opinion concerning any possible long term consequences or new developments which may come from using any such new designs or systems.\\r\\ne. The precise way or ways in which the Competitor feels the new design or system will enhance the performance of the car.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c1.5 New systems or technologies\\r\\nAny new system, procedure or technology not specifically covered by these regulations, but which is deemed permissible by the FIA Formula One Technical Department, will only be admitted until the end of the Championship during which it is introduced. Following this the Formula One Commission will be asked to review the technology concerned and, if they feel it adds no value to Formula One in general, it may be specifically prohibited by the FIA.\\r\\nAny team whose technology is prohibited in this way will then be required to publish full technical details of the relevant system or procedure.\\r\\n1.6 Duty of Competitor\\r\\nIt is the duty of each Competitor to satisfy the FIA technical delegate and the stewards that his Formula 1 Car complies with these regulations in their entirety at all times during a Competition.\\r\\nThe design of the car, its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety features, demonstrate their compliance with these regulations by means of physical inspection of hardware or materials. Unless explicitly requested by an Article, no mechanical design may rely upon software inspection as a means of ensuring its compliance.\\r\\nDue to their nature, the compliance of electronic systems may be assessed by means of inspection of hardware, software and data.\\r\\nCAD models may be requested by the FIA in order to check compliance with the Regulations. Such models should be supplied in a format and by a method specified by the FIA. In such cases, scanning technology will be used by the FIA to check that the physical car is the same as the inspected CAD models.\\r\\nEach competitor must ensure that all relevant personnel (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) associated with its participation in the Championship are appropriately informed with respect to the ways in which their areas of responsibility may impact the competitor\\'s compliance with the Regulations.\\r\\nEach competitor must ensure that the FIA ethics and compliance hotline with respect to the Regulations is clearly communicated to all these individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cARTICLE 2: DEFINITIONS\\r\\n2.1 Formula One Car An automobile (the car) designed solely for speed races on circuits or closed courses that is propelled by its own means, moving by constantly taking real support on the ground, of which the propulsion and steering are under the direct control of a driver aboard the vehicle. It runs on four non-aligned complete wheels, with wheel centres that are arranged symmetrically about the car centre plane, when in the straight-ahead position, to form the front and rear axles.\\r\\n2.2 Competition As defined in Article 2.2 of the Sporting Regulations\\r\\n2.3 Component classification categories The terms LTC, SSC, TRC and OSC defined in Articles 17.3 to 17.6 and used throughout the Regulations, refer to the classification of the car\\'s components in terms of their Design, Intellectual Property, Manufacture and Supply.\\r\\n2.4 Car mass Is the mass of the car with the driver, wearing his complete racing apparel, at all times during the Competition.\\r\\n2.5 Sprung mass All parts of the car that are entirely supported by the sprung suspension.\\r\\n2.6 Unsprung mass All parts of the car composing the sprung suspension external to the sprung mass and/or not entirely supported by the sprung suspension. For the purpose of this definition the boundary between sprung and unsprung mass will be at the suspension members\\' inboard attachments.\\r\\n2.7 Power unit As defined in Article 5.1.2\\r\\n2.8 Power train As defined in Article 5.1.1\\r\\n2.9 Geometrical planes 2.9.1 Reference plane: a nominally horizontal plane sitting at the bottom of the sprung part of the\\r\\ncar, with the exception of the plank assembly defined in Article 3.5.9. 2.9.2 Centre plane: a vertical plane, which is perpendicular to the reference plane and aligned with\\r\\nthe direction of motion of the car. The centre plane is the nominal plane of symmetry of the car. 2.9.3 Plane A-A (also referred to as \"A-A\"): a plane which is perpendicular to both the reference and centre planes, which lies on the front bulkhead of the survival cell that is defined in Article 12, or up to 100mm behind it. 2.9.4 Plane C-C (also referred to as \"C-C\"): a plane which is parallel to A-A, whose position is defined in Article 12.1.4.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c2.10 Reference Volumes and Surfaces\\r\\n\"Reference Volumes\" and \"Reference Surfaces\" and their position in space are defined in Appendix 1 using the car\\'s coordinate system, and are used throughout the Technical Regulations for geometrical constraints. For convenience, Reference Volumes are preceded by the prefix \"RV-\" and Reference Surfaces by the prefix \"RS-\".\\r\\n2.11 Coordinate system and references\\r\\n2.11.1 A right-handed Cartesian (X, Y, Z) coordinate system will be used in these regulations, defined in the following way:\\r\\na. The X axis is in the rearwards longitudinal direction, and is parallel to the reference and car centre planes. Depending on the regulation in question, the local origin can vary, and the following convention is used:\\r\\ni. XA=0mm is defined to be on plane A-A\\r\\nii. XB=0mm is defined to be on plane B-B\\r\\niii. XC=0mm is defined to be on plane C-C\\r\\niv. The planes XF=0 and XR=0 are defined as the planes which respectively pass through the origin of the two front or two rear wheels\\' coordinate systems, as defined in Article 2.11.3, with the wheels in the straight ahead position and the car at the Legality Ride Height, as defined in Article 10.1.4.\\r\\nv. XDIF=0mm is defined as the output axis of the final drive as defined in Article 9.6.1.\\r\\nvi. XPU=0mm is defined to pass through the forward most mounting face of the studs connecting the power unit to the survival cell, as defined in Article 5.4.8.\\r\\nb. The Y axis is normal to the X axis, parallel to the reference plane, and pointing to the right hand side of the car. Y=0mm is defined to be on the car centre plane.\\r\\nc. The Z axis is normal to the reference plane and points upwards. Z=0mm is defined to be on the reference plane\\r\\n2.11.2 Further conventions:\\r\\na. If no units are specified, it is implicit the unit will be in millimetres\\r\\nb. The suffix \"L\" may be used for local coordinates in specific rules, i.e. XL, YL, ZL, where these local axes are defined within a specific Article for local use.\\r\\nc. Planes will be referred to as the axis to which they are normal to (e.g. X-plane or XA=300 plane).\\r\\nd. Unless otherwise specified, the positive side of the Y axis is used in the various articles and it is implicit that a symmetrical rule applies for the other side of the car. The terms \"inboard\" or \"outboard\", when used in reference to the Y coordinate, respectively refer to closer to or further away from the car centre plane.\\r\\ne. Unless otherwise specified any measurements and references will be with the wheels in the straight ahead position (the wheel rotation axis lying within an X plane).\\r\\nf. Unless otherwise specified, when a viewing direction is stated, \"front\" and \"rear\" are parallel to the X axis, \"side\" is parallel to the Y axis (in the direction towards the car centre plane) and \"above\", \"below\" and \"plan\" are parallel to the Z axis.\\r\\ng. Unless otherwise specified, directions of angles, slopes and incidences are taken in context of the right-handed Cartesian coordinate system defined in 2.11.1. For example, a positive slope within a Y-Plane would be characterised by positively increasing X and Z components.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c2.11.3 A Cartesian (XW, YW, ZW) coordinate system will be used for each wheel, defined in the following way:\\r\\na. The XW axis lies on the inboard plane of the wheel rim, passes through its rotational axis and points in the rearward longitudinal direction. XW=0mm is defined to be on the wheel rotational axis. The XW axis is parallel to the car centre plane and to the reference plane, with the wheel in the straight-ahead position and the car at its legality ride height, as defined in Article 10.1.4.\\r\\nb. The YW axis is normal to the inboard plane of the wheel rim and points towards the car centre plane. YW=0mm is defined to be on the inboard plane of the wheel rim. Referring to this coordinate, the terms \"inboard\" or \"outboard\" respectively refer to closer to or further away from the car centre plane.\\r\\nc. The ZW axis is normal to both the XW and YW axes and points upwards. ZW=0 is defined to be on the wheel rotational axis.\\r\\nd.

The concave radius of curvature of the surface at that point will be defined as the minimum concave radius of curvature obtained when the intersecting plane is swept through 180 degrees around the normal line. The convex radius of curvature of that surface at that point will be defined as the minimum convex radius of curvature obtained when the intersecting plane is swept through 180 degrees around the normal line.\\r\\nAs an example, and for the sake of clarity, the aerodynamic surface of a solid sphere would be the surface where this sphere makes contact with the external airstream, and would be considered to be a convex surface.\\r\\n3.1.5 Normal to an aerodynamic surface or curve\\r\\nThe normal applied to an aerodynamic surface at a given point is a vector which is perpendicular to the surface at that point and points towards the local external air stream.\\r\\nThe normal to a curve at a given point will be considered to be the normal to the surface containing the curve at the same point.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c3.1.6\\r\\n3.1.7 3.1.8 3.1.9\\r\\n3.1.10 3.1.11\\r\\n\\r\\nTangency Continuity\\r\\nTangency Continuity at a given point of a curve or at a given point of a surface, is satisfied if the value of the tangent is continuous.\\r\\nTangency Continuity at intersections between two curves or two surfaces, is satisfied if the two curves or two surfaces at the intersection are tangent to one another and also have their normal coincident with each other.\\r\\nWhere two adjacent surfaces are not tangent continuous but could be made so by applying a fillet radius of no more than 1mm along their boundary, these surfaces will be considered tangent continuous at this boundary whether or not the fillet radius is applied, as long as such a fillet radius is permitted according to the relevant article.\\r\\nCurvature Continuity\\r\\nCurvature Continuity between two curves, at a given point of a curve, between two surfaces or within a surface is satisfied if the value of the curvature is continuous and in the same direction.\\r\\nOpen and closed sections\\r\\nWithin the prescribed limitations of the relevant regulation, a section through the bodywork when intersected with a defined plane will be considered closed if it forms a complete boundary by itself otherwise it will be considered open.\\r\\nFillet Radius\\r\\nAn arc with radius of curvature respecting the limit(s) specified, connecting two fully defined surfaces tangentially with no inflection and perpendicular to the intersection between them. Unless otherwise specified, fillet radii may change in magnitude around the periphery of the boundary around which they are defined, but such changes must be continuous.\\r\\nIf there exists a discontinuity in tangency at the trailing edge of the intersection between the parts to be joined by the fillet, then a closed aerodynamic fairing may be added immediately behind the trailing edge. This fairing must be no larger in cross section than the preceding fillet and any trailing edge immediately adjacent to the fillet and no longer than three times the maximum fillet arc radius at this point.\\r\\nAerodynamic seal\\r\\nThe function by which the flow between two regions of different pressure is kept to the minimum feasible magnitude.\\r\\nGurney\\r\\nA component fitted to the trailing edge of a profile in order to adjust its aerodynamic performance. In any plane normal to the trailing edge of the profile, the Gurney must contain a flat section no more than 1mm thick, and of a given height (defined as the size of the Gurney), and a bonding flange onto the surface of the wing which may be no more than 20mm long and 1mm thick. No part of the Gurney may protrude behind a line that is normal to the surface on which the Gurney is applied at the point of the trailing edge of the profile.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.2 General Principles and Legality Checking\\r\\n3.2.1 Objective of Article 3\\r\\nAn important objective of the Regulations in Article 3 is to enable cars to race closely, by ensuring that the aerodynamic performance loss of a car following another car is kept to a minimum. In order to verify whether this objective has been achieved, Competitors may be required on request to supply the FIA with any relevant information.\\r\\nIn any case the Intellectual Property of this information, will remain the property of the Competitor, will be protected and not divulged to any third party.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c3.2.2 Aerodynamic Influence\\r\\nWith the exception of the driver adjustable bodywork described in Article 3.10.10 (in addition to minimal parts solely associated with its actuation) and the flexible seals specifically permitted by Articles 3.13 and 3.14.4, all aerodynamic components or bodywork influencing the car\\'s aerodynamic performance must be rigidly secured and immobile with respect to their frame of reference defined in Article 3.3. Furthermore, these components must produce a uniform, solid, hard, continuous, impervious surface under all circumstances.\\r\\nAny device or construction that is designed to bridge the gap between the sprung part of the car and the ground is prohibited under all circumstances.\\r\\nWith the exception of the parts necessary for the adjustment described in Article 3.10.10, or any incidental movement due to the steering system, any car system, device or procedure which uses driver movement as a means of altering the aerodynamic characteristics of the car is prohibited.\\r\\nThe Aerodynamic influence of any component of the car not considered to be bodywork must be incidental to its main function. Any design which aims to maximise such an aerodynamic influence is prohibited.\\r\\n3.2.3 Symmetry\\r\\nAll bodywork must be nominally symmetrical with respect to Y=0. Consequently, and unless otherwise specified, any regulation in Article 3 concerning one side of the car will be assumed to be valid for the other side of the car and references to maximum permissible numbers of components in Article 3 will also refer to the one side of the car.\\r\\nMinimal exceptions to the requirement of symmetry of this Article will be accepted for the installation of non-symmetrical mechanical components of the car, for asymmetrical cooling requirements or for asymmetrical angle adjustment of the front flap defined in Article 3.9.7.\\r\\nBodywork on the unsprung mass must respect this Article when the suspension position of each wheel is virtually re-orientated so that its wheel coordinate system axes (described in Article 2.11.3) are parallel to their respective axis of the car coordinate system (described in Article 2.11.1).\\r\\n3.2.4 Digital legality checking\\r\\nThe assessment of the car\\'s compliance with the Aerodynamic Regulations will be carried out digitally using CAD models provided by the teams. In these models:\\r\\na. Components may only be designed to the edge of a Reference Volume or in such way as to satisfy with a precise geometrical feature, or to the limit of a geometrical criterion with infinite precision (save for the normal round-off discrepancies of the CAD system), provided that such a design is not intended to circumvent the intention of the relevant regulation as applied to the physical car. when the regulations specifically require an aspect of the bodywork to be designed to this limit, or it can be demonstrated that the design does not rely on lying exactly on this limit to conform to the regulations, such that it is possible for the physical bodywork to comply.\\r\\nb. Components which must follow a precise shape, surface or plane must be designed without any tolerance, save for the normal round-off discrepancies of the CAD system.\\r\\n3.2.5 Physical legality checking\\r\\nThe cars may be measured during a Competition in order to check their conformance to the CAD models discussed in Article 3.2.4 and to ensure they remain inside the Reference Volumes.\\r\\na. Unless otherwise specified, a tolerance of \\xef\\xbf\\xbd3mm will be accepted for manufacturing purposes only with respect to the CAD surfaces. Where measured surfaces lie outside of this tolerance but remain within the Reference Volumes, a Competitor may be required to provide additional information (e.g. revised CAD geometry) to demonstrate compliance with the regulations. Any discrepancies contrived to create a special aerodynamic effect or surface finish will not be permitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cb. Irrespective of a), geometrical discrepancies at the limits of the Reference Volumes must be such that the measured component remains inside the Reference Volume.\\r\\nc. A positional tolerance of +/- 2mm will be accepted for the Front Wing Bodywork, Rear Wing Bodywork, Exhaust Tailpipe, Floor Bodywork behind XR=0, and Tail. This will be assessed by realigning each of the groups of Reference Volumes and Reference Surfaces that define the assemblies, by up to 2mm from their original position, to best fit the measured geometry.\\r\\nd. Irrespective of b), a tolerance of Z=+/-2mm will be accepted for parts of the car lying on the Z=0 plane, with -375  Y  375 and ahead of XR=0.\\r\\ne.

Tape, provided it does not achieve an aerodynamic effect otherwise not permitted by Article 3\\r\\niii. Junctions between bodywork panels\\r\\niv. Local bodywork fixing details\\r\\n3.2.6 Datum Points\\r\\nAll cars must be equipped with mountings for optical targets that enable the car\\'s datum to be determined for scrutineering in the following locations:\\r\\ni. One on the forward part of the top of the survival cell.\\r\\nii. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the top of the survival cell close to XB=0.\\r\\niii. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the side of the survival cell close to XB=0.\\r\\niv. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the side of the survival cell close to the rear mounts of the secondary roll structure.\\r\\nv.

One probed point on the RIS or gearbox case.\\r\\nIn all cases, a file with required datum points must be supplied for each survival cell.\\r\\nFor deflection testing, all cars must be provided with a means of mounting a reference artefact to the RIS. This mounting may be temporary, but must be rigid with respect to the underlying car structure.\\r\\nFull details of the requirements are given in the Appendix the Technical and Sporting Regulations.\\r\\n3.2.7 Section titles and Article titles within this article have no regulatory value.\\r\\n3.2.8 Static pressure tappings are permitted in surfaces, provided that they;\\r\\ni.

A single Rear Scoop Lip which must lie within RV-RWH-LIP. Furthermore:\\r\\ni. Its complete surface must be tangent continuous and contain no more than a single section in any XW plane.\\r\\nii. For the parts of the Rear Scoop Lip surface that are visible when viewed parallel to the YW axis from inboard, the radius of curvature must be greater than 20mm. This is with the exception of regions of its surface that are within 5mm of the boundary of the Rear Scoop Lip when viewed parallel to the YW axis from inboard.\\r\\niii. Once the Rear Scoop Lip has been fully defined, it must be trimmed to the Rear Scoop and Rear Drum, such that no overlapping surfaces remain, and a fillet radius of no greater than 25mm may be applied at their boundaries. Once the fillet radius has been applied the external surfaces at the boundaries between adjacent sections of the Rear Scoop Lip and the Rear Scoop and Rear Drum must maintain tangent continuity in any XW, YW or ZW plane\\r\\nf. Once the requirements of paragraph e) above have been satisfied, additional geometry may be added to the combined rear drum and scoop surfaces, for the sole purpose of protecting the scoop inlet from debris ingestion, providing this geometry satisfies the following criteria:\\r\\ni. its entire surface sits within either RV-RWH-LIP or RV-RWH-SCP\\r\\nii. before the bodies are trimmed to the Rear Scoop, Rear Lip or Rear Drum, the additional geometry must not contain any open sections in any Xw, Yw and Zw planes\\r\\niii. on any Yw plane, any individual closed section must have a cross-sectional area less than 8mm2, with the exception of a fillet radius of no larger than 5mm at the boundaries.\\r\\nOnce the Front and Rear Scoop have been defined, trimmed to their respective Drums, had the apertures permitted in c. and d. applied, and in the case of the Rear Wheel Bodywork, the Rear Scoop Lip has been fully defined and trimmed to the Rear Scoop and Rear Drum, the following additional apertures may be added:\\r\\ng.

This must be the case whether the deflection is increasing, decreasing, or held constant. The test will have no more than a maximum load of 8000N or a maximum deflection of 15mm (whichever is reached first) unless specifically requested by the FIA to investigate behaviour above these limits.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cThe load deflection relationship must be strictly monotonic with both increasing and decreasing deflection.\\r\\n3.15.7 Outboard Floor Flexibility\\r\\na.

The load will be applied using a 50mm diameter ram and an adaptor of the same size in an upwards or downwards direction. Teams must supply the latter when such a test is deemed necessary.\\r\\nc. Bodywork may deflect no more than 8mm 5mm vertically when a [0, 0, -250]N load is applied and no more than 12mm 5mm vertically when a [0, 0, 250]N load is applied. The load will be applied simultaneously to the left and right sides of the floor at an Xposition of XR=-950 or XR=-525. A variation of X=\\xef\\xbf\\xbd30mm is permitted at the Competitor\\'s discretion.\\r\\nThe load will be applied at the intersection of an X-plane at the loading position and a straight line which is the average (\"least-squares\") of the plan view of the outer edge of the floor, displaced in the inboard Y direction by 10mm, between 100mm ahead and 100mm behind this X-plane.\\r\\nFour adaptors (two per side), each 200mm in X, must be provided by each Competitor to be fitted to the outer edges of the floor assembly and extend 100mm forwards and 100mm rearwards of the load application point. These adaptors may engage with up to 20mm of the floor measured in Y. At no time during a test may the non-loaded surface contact the floor. Details of these adaptors are given in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.\\r\\nc. The outboard edge of the Floor Bodywork Group may deflect no more than 8mm in Z at any point between XR = -1260 and XR = -350 when a distributed load of [0, 0, -600]N is applied to each side of the car.\\r\\nThe load will be applied simultaneously at 6 points on each side of the car, nominally at: [XR, Y] = [-480, 652.2], [-635, 686.3], [-790, 714.4], [-945, 736.7], [-1100, 753.3], and [-1255, 764.2]. A 2mm tolerance on position will be permitted for manufacturing reasons.\\r\\nWhen viewed from above, and with the Floor Bodywork Group as fully defined in Article 3.5.6 in place, nothing other than the bodywork may be visible within 15mm of any load application point. A load application point that does not meet this requirement may be moved, in X and/or in Y, by the minimum amount necessary to comply. The FIA may require load points to be moved if, in their view, the load location or the floor shape has been specifically designed to permit greater levels of outboard floor flexibility in untested regions of the floor.\\r\\nOnce the load application positions are fully defined, Teams must provide a suitable means of applying the load to the upper surface of the bodywork. The load will be applied through a rod of diameter 2.3mm. Details of this arrangement are provided in the appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. The contact of any loadspreader with the bodywork must lie within a cylinder of diameter 25mm, coaxial with the load application axis. If the Team\\'s preferred method requires through-holes, these holes must be sealed on either or both of the upper and lower surfaces at all times the car is on the circuit and during any assessment of any visibility from above around load application points.\\r\\nLoads will be applied to these rods in two stages:\\r\\ni.

Bodywork within RV-PLANK may deflect no more than 2mm at the two holes in the plank at XF=1080 and no more than 2mm at the rearmost hole, when the car, without driver, is supported at these positions. The car will be supported on 70mm diameter pads, centred on the holes, and only in contact with the underside of the plank assembly. The displacement will be measured at the supports, relative to the reference plane at the centre of each hole.\\r\\nFurthermore, the stiffness for any load deflection exceeding that defined in the previous paragraph must be no less than 15kN/mm.\\r\\nCompetitors will be required to demonstrate the local vertical stiffness and design installation of the skids and plank to the FIA for the regions around the periphery of each of these three holes. Compliance with Article 3.5.9.e. will only be assessed in the regions that are at least 90% as stiff as the stiffest part of the periphery. Any designs intended to protect these regions of the periphery from wear will not be accepted.\\r\\nCompetitors will be required to demonstrate compliance with these provisions by way of a detailed inspection of both the CAD and the physical installation, as well as Finite Element analysis.\\r\\nb. Bodywork on the reference plane may deflect no more than 0.2mm when the car, without driver, is supported at the two holes in the plank at XF=1080 and at the rearmost hole in the plank.

Acceptable compounds and compound classes are defined in 16.2 and 16.4.3. In addition, to cover the presence of low level impurities, the sum of components lying outside the 16.2 and 16.4.3 definitions are limited to 1% max m/m of the total fuel.\\r\\n\\r\\n16.1.3 Only approved fuel (Article 16.5) may be released into the engine combustion chamber by the fuel injector (5.1.12).\\r\\n\\r\\n16.1.4 3 Only ambient air may be mixed with the fuel as an oxidant.\\r\\n\\r\\n16.1.5 4 The function of an engine oil is to lubricate moving parts, to improve the overall efficiency of the engine by reducing friction and to reduce wear. It also cleans, inhibits corrosion, improves sealing, and cools the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts. Engine oils should not enhance the properties of the fuel nor energize the combustion. The presence of any component that cannot be rationally associated with the defined functions of the engine oil will be deemed unacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\n16.1.6 5 Any fuel or engine oil, which appears to have been formulated in order to subvert the purpose of this regulation, will be deemed to be outside it.\\r\\n\\r\\n16.1.7 6 All Competitors must be in possession of a Material Safety Data Sheet for each type of fuel or engine oil used.

The Intellectual Property involved in the operation of such shared facilities may be used by and/or disclosed to the sharing party but the results of any experimental or test work carried out on such facilities may only be used by the originator of the work. Where facilities are shared, robust processes must be put in place to ensure there is no transfer of Intellectual Property through common personnel and that all data can only be accessed by the originator of the work. Any such sharing of facilities must be declared to the FIA with a full description of the work that will be carried out, and also of the processes that will be put in place in order to avoid an exchange of information that could lead to the transfer of knowledge leading to the performance enhancement of an LTC (as required by Article 17.3.4), or a TRC (as required by Article 17.5.8) or an OSC (as required by Article 17.6.11).\\r\\n\\r\\n17.3 Listed Team Components (LTC)\\r\\n\\r\\n17.3.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listed Team Components\" (LTC) are components whose design, manufacture and Intellectual Property is owned and/or controlled by a single Competitor or its agents on an exclusive basis (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Appendix 5).\\r\\n\\r\\n17.3.2\\r\\n\\r\\nA Competitor may only use LTC in its Formula One cars that it has designed (including, for the avoidance of doubt, its three-dimensional shape and the evolution history leading to it, any preliminary designs, simulations, wind tunnel tests, and analysis) and manufactured itself.

For the purpose of this Article, \"reverse engineering\" shall mean:\\r\\na. The use of photographs or images, combined with software that converts them to point clouds, curves, surfaces, or allows CAD geometry to be overlaid onto or extracted from the photograph or image\\r\\nb. The use of stereophotogrammetry, 3D cameras or any 3D stereoscopic techniques\\r\\nc. Any form of contact or non-contact surface scanning\\r\\nd. Any technique that projects points or curves on a surface so as to facilitate the reverseengineering process\\r\\nIn cases where isolated features of a Competitor\\'s LTC(s) may closely resemble the features of another Competitor\\'s LTC(s), it will be the role of the FIA to determine whether this resemblance is the result of reverse engineering or of legitimate independent work. The following further provisions apply:\\r\\ne. All Competitors must provide to the FIA, upon request, any data or other information that is required to demonstrate compliance with this Article.\\r\\nf. For all LTCs used during the Championship, the restrictions described in this Article apply to their entire design process, including actions carried out before the calendar year of the Championship.\\r\\ng. The FIA may issue guidance from time to time to define more specifically the requirements and constraints of this Article.\\r\\nNo Competitor may, either directly or via a third party:\\r\\na. pass on any information in respect of its LTC (including but not limited to data, designs, drawings, or any other Intellectual Property) to another Competitor or receive any information from another Competitor in respect of that Competitor\\'s LTC; or\\r\\nb. receive consultancy or any other kind of services from another Competitor in relation to LTC, or supply any such services to another Competitor; or\\r\\nc. pass any methodology which can be used to enhance the performance of LTC (including but not limited to simulation software, analysis tools, etc.) to another Competitor, or receive any such methodology from another Competitor.\\r\\nNotwithstanding the provision of this Article, Supplying Power Unit Manufacturers or Supplying Competitors of TRCs may carry out the assembly of the components they supply with adjacent LTC components of the Customer Competitor. In such cases, the Customer Competitor may provide the minimal assembly information of the LTCs they need to assemble to the supplying Competitor or Power Unit Manufacturer. The FIA must approve such a transaction to its absolute discretion and must be satisfied that it is not used as a means to circumvent the provisions of Article 17.3.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n136\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c17.3.5\\r\\n\\r\\nA Competitor (or its agents) must have exclusive ownership of (or the Competitor must have the exclusive right to use in the Championship) any and all rights, information or data of any nature (including but not limited to all aspects of the design, manufacturing, know-how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) in respect of the LTC in its Formula One cars. However, notwithstanding the foregoing:\\r\\na. the use of specialist Intellectual Property or technology of third parties is permitted in respect of LTC, provided that this Intellectual Property or technology is commercially available to all Competitors. The principal parameters of such components must in any case be determined by the Competitor and not be available to other Competitors;\\r\\nb. Similarly, it is permitted to use commercially available sub-components or sub-assemblies in respect of LTC, provided these are commercially available to all Competitors. This provision applies if these components or sub-assemblies are not specifically listed as LTC. The FIA may request Competitors to provide a list of such sub-components and their technical specification. The FIA may classify such sub-components or sub-assemblies as LTC if it deems that they are being contrived to circumvent the purpose of this Article 17.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.4 Standard Supply Components (SSC)\\r\\n\\r\\n17.4.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Standard Supply Components\" (SSC) are components whose design and manufacture will be carried out by a supplier appointed by the FIA, to be supplied on an identical technical and commercial basis to each Competitor (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Appendix 5).\\r\\n\\r\\n17.4.2\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a selection process fail to lead to appointment of a supplier of a component classified as a SSC, or should the arrangement with such supplier be terminated for whatever reason, the FIA reserves the right to re-classify the SSC as an LTC, TRC, or OSC and to introduce appropriate technical rules in the relevant Article of these Technical Regulations in order to control the technical specification and cost of this component.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.4.3\\r\\n\\r\\nComponents supplied as SSC must not be modified, and they must be installed and operated exactly as specified by the supplier, except for minor changes explicitly permitted in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. However, each Competitor is responsible for communicating directly to the relevant SSC supplier, while keeping the FIA informed at all times, regarding any issues of compatibility, reliability or safety in respect of a SSC. This may include submitting proposals for modifications to the SSC that a Competitor considers should be made to ensure the necessary levels of safety, compatibility and reliability while at all times having due regard to cost and performance implications. In consultation with the relevant SSC supplier, the FIA will consider in good faith all issues raised (and modifications proposed) during the consultation process, and shall determine in its sole discretion whether or not to take any action. In exceptional circumstances, where a Competitor establishes that a SSC is critically incompatible, unreliable or unsafe, the FIA may, at its sole discretion, authorise such Competitor to carry out modifications to the SSC in question or use an alternative component in order to resolve the compatibility, reliability or safety issue. Permission for such a modification or usage of an alternative component will be communicated to all Competitors, and will continue to be applied until the relevant supplier introduces a new specification that resolves the reliability, compatibility or safety concern. In accordance with the severity of the reliability, compatibility or safety concern, the FIA may authorise a phased introduction of the modified SSC. In such cases, after consultation with Competitors and with the Supplier, the FIA will define the period of the phase-in, and any measures that need to be taken to ensure that no performance advantage (e.g., mass) is obtained by using either the old or the new specification of the SSC.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.4.4\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of an SSC is mandatory and the particular function of that SSC must not be by-passed, replaced, duplicated or complemented by another component. This provision also applies to any TCC as defined in the Sporting Regulations. In exceptional circumstances, the FIA, at its sole discretion may authorise the use of alternative components.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.4.5 No Competitor may, either directly or via a third party pass any information (including but not limited to data, know how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) or\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n137\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cmethodology (including but not limited to simulation software, analysis tools, etc.) which can be used to enhance the performance of a SSC to another Competitor, or receive any such methodology from another Competitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5 Transferable Components (TRC)\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Transferable Components\" (TRC) are components whose design, manufacture and Intellectual Property resides within a single Supplying Competitor, or third party, but can be supplied to another Customer Competitor (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Appendix 5).\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5.2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provisions of this Article 17.5 regard the supply of such TRC components by a Supplying Competitor or a third party to a Customer Competitor. In the event a component classified as TRC does not get supplied to any Customer Competitor, the rules governing such a component will be identical to the rules governing LTC\\'s. Furthermore, with regard to any component classed as TRC, any two teams who are not operating in a Supplying Competitor-Customer Competitor relationship with regard to the specific component must observe all the rules that govern LTC\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5.3\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supplying Competitor (or its agent) must own and/or control all rights, information and/or data of any nature (including all aspects of the design, manufacturing, know-how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) in respect of TRC, but it may supply such TRC to other Competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5.4\\r\\n\\r\\nThe components supplied as TRC by a Supplying Competitor to a Customer Competitor must be components identical to those used by the Supplying Competitor in the same Championship or a previous one. Under no circumstances is it permitted for the Supplying Competitor to carry out the design or manufacture of bespoke TRC\\'s for the specific use by a Customer Competitor. The Customer Competitor may however elect to replace or modify sub components of a TRC, but in that case all the related additional work (including, but not limited to Research and Development, simulations, design, manufacture etc.) must be carried out by the Customer Competitor or its agents. In exceptional circumstances, and with the prior approval of the FIA, the Supplying Competitor may provide assistance to the Customer Competitor for the resolution of reliability or safety issues regarding the TRC.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5.5 The Supplying Competitor may outsource the design (intended for this Article as any R&D, Engineering and CAD design) and/or manufacture of any TRC to a third party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Associate of such Competitor) provided that:\\r\\n\\r\\na. the third party to whom manufacture of the TRC is Outsourced may not be another Competitor; and\\r\\n\\r\\nb. the third party to whom design of the TRC is Outsourced may not be another Competitor, or a party that directly or indirectly designs TRCs or LTCs for any other Competitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n17.5.6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supplying Competitor (or its agents) must have exclusive ownership of and/or control over any and all rights, information or data of any nature (including but not limited to all aspects of the design, manufacturing, know-how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) in respect of the TRC in its Formula One cars. However, notwithstanding the foregoing:\\r\\n\\r\\na. the use of specialist Intellectual Property or technology of third parties is permitted in respect of TRC, provided that this Intellectual Property or technology is commercially available to all Competitors.

The primary usage of these Reference Volumes and Surfaces is Aerodynamic legality, in conjunction with Article 3. However numerous further usages of such definitions are used in other Articles.\\r\\n1.2 Unless otherwise stated, only the declared reference section, reference surface or reference volume from each Article can be used to assess legality. All other geometry used during the construction of these sections, surfaces or volumes must be considered for reference purposes only.\\r\\n1.3 In cases where an object (surface or volume) is trimmed using a surface, this must be performed by first finding the intersection between the object and the surface and then partitioning the object into two, by separating it at this intersection. One of these two parts is then discarded according to the relevant Article and the residual of the trimmed object is all that remains after the operation.\\r\\n1.4 All volumes are implicitly symmetrical about the car centre plane.\\r\\n1.5 The prefix \"RV-\" always refers to a Reference Volume, whereas the prefix \"RS-\" refers to a Reference Surface.\\r\\n1.6 The CAD models of all the volumes and surfaces listed in this Appendix are available for Teams to download with a standard range of parameters. The FIA will provide a Team with a specific model on request.\\r\\n1.7 Should an inconsistency arise between a volume generated manually using the process outlined in this Article, or a volume that has been downloaded by the process outlined in \\xef\\xbf\\xbd1.6, the FIA will adjudicate on a case-by-case basis the volume that will be applicable and correct the one that will be judged to have an inconsistency or error.\\r\\n2 Floor Body Planform Reference Surface (RS-FLOOR-PLAN)\\r\\nRS-FLOOR-PLAN is composed of the following elements:\\r\\n2.1 On the plane Z=450, a surface enclosed by the following peripheral elements:\\r\\na.

Should a customer Competitor consider that the change has an unreasonable impact on the Power Unit installation in the car, they may contact the FIA within 7 days of the notification. The FIA will then contact the relevant Power Unit Manufacturer and its customer Competitors in order to conduct its investigation. If the FIA is satisfied, in its absolute discretion, that these changes are acceptable, the FIA will confirm to the Power Unit manufacturer and the customer Competitors within 14 days that they may be carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 Homologation dossier\\r\\n2.1 Any Power Unit Manufacturer intending to homologate a Power Unit for use by one or more Competitors in the 2022 to 2025 Championships must submit to the FIA a Power Unit homologation dossier before 1 March of the year in which it intends to supply such power unit for use during the Championship period indicated. Each Power Unit Manufacturer shall be permitted to present only one homologation dossier with respect to the period and the homologation granted will be valid until the end of the 2025 Championship.\\r\\n2.2 The homologation dossier must:\\r\\na. include details of all the parts described as \"INC\" in the \"App. 4 PU homol.\" column of Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations.\\r\\nb. include all documents required in section 1 of this Appendix.\\r\\nc. be submitted and updated according to the procedure detailed in the Appendix of the Regulations.\\r\\n2.3 A Power Unit will be homologated for a Competitor once a complete homologation dossier has been submitted by the relevant Power Unit Manufacturer and has been approved by the FIA, such approval to take place within 14 days from the submission of the homologation dossier.\\r\\n2.4 Each Power Unit Manufacturer must submit one homologation dossier which applies to all Competitors it intends to supply. Only the fuel specification, the engine oil specification and Power Unit wirings may differ between Competitors. In this event they must be declared separately in the dedicated sections of the homologation dossier.\\r\\nAll Power Units supplied by a single Power Unit Manufacturer must also be operated in the same way, they must therefore be:\\r\\na. Identical according to the dossier for each Competitor, and;\\r\\nUnless a Competitor informs the FIA Technical Department that they have declined any of the following, they must be:\\r\\nb. Run with identical software for PU control and must be capable of being operated in precisely the same way.\\r\\nc. Run with identical specifications of engine oil and fuel unless an alternative supplier is preferred by a customer Competitor.\\r\\n2.5 Once a Power Unit has been homologated, any subsequent changes as permitted by paragraphs 4 & 5 below will not constitute a new dossier but will instead be considered as updates to the initial dossier. The documentation associated to the modified parts shall be updated accordingly in the dossier as per the procedure described in the Appendix of the Regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n3 Power unit maximum supply price\\r\\nThe Power Unit supply perimeter listed in the corresponding column of Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations shall be supplied at the maximum price of fifteen million euros. The supply of additional goods or services not listed in the Appendix hereto (which shall be agreed between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the Competitor) shall incur additional charges, the amount of which shall be based on the usages and practices generally\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n168\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0crecognised and respected in the market for the supply of parts and services in the Championship. In case of any alleged material breach or alleged material failure to comply with the provisions of this Paragraph 3, the FIA shall be entitled to engage proceedings before the FIA International Tribunal against the Power Unit Manufacturer. In the case that, in accordance of the provisions of the Code and of the Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, the International Tribunal rules that the Power Unit Manufacturer has materially breached or materially failed to comply with this Paragraph 3, the International Tribunal may impose on the Power Unit Manufacturer concerned (to the exclusion of any other sanction it may have the power to impose), a fine the amount of which shall be no more than fifteen million euros and shall be determined, on a case by case basis, depending on the merits and circumstances of the applicable case. During its first two Championship seasons (or part thereof), whether consecutive or not, within the [2014-2025] period, a manufacturer will not be required to comply with the maximum price as set out above.\\r\\n4 Specification of PU Elements during the 2022-2025 period\\r\\n4.1 For the purposes of this Article, a specification upgrade is defined as a modification of a homologated part for any purpose other than those listed in 5.1 below.\\r\\n4.2 With reference to Article 28.2 of the Sporting Regulations, each Power Unit Manufacturer may supply only the maximum number of specification upgrades of PU elements as set in the second table of Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations during a Championship season, except for any changes permitted by the FIA in accordance with the procedures set out in Paragraph 5 below.\\r\\n4.3 In order to be registered, a specification upgrade must be used by at least one car powered by the Power Unit Manufacturer no later than:\\r\\n the first Event following the deadline specified in the second table of Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations if at least one car would incur no penalty under art. 28.3 of the Sporting Regulations.\\r\\n the fifth Event following the deadline specified in the second table of Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations if all cars would incur a penalty under art. 28.3 of the Sporting Regulations.\\r\\n4.4 Requests for the homologation of parts with permitted specification upgrades must be submitted at least 14 days before the requested date of homologation.\\r\\n4.5 With reference to Article 40.3 of the Sporting Regulations, if a Power Unit part is subsequently replaced by another of a different specification according to 4.2 after qualifying practice, the replacement Power Unit part will not be considered the same in design or similar in mass, inertia or function.\\r\\n4.6 A customer Competitor may refuse a specification upgrade, or request a delay, in case of installation issues of the new Power Unit element in its car. The customer Competitor must apply in writing to the FIA Technical Department and must provide all necessary supporting information. If the FIA is satisfied, in its absolute discretion, that the installation issues are genuine, they will confirm approval to the customer Competitor and to the Power Unit Manufacturer. In this case, the provisions of 6.2 below won\\'t apply.\\r\\n5 Permitted modifications to the homologated power unit elements\\r\\n5.1 A manufacturer may apply to the FIA during the course of the homologation period to carry out modifications to the homologated Power Unit elements for the sole purposes of reliability, safety, cost saving, or minimal incidental changes permitted in 5.4 below.\\r\\nApplications must be made in writing to the FIA Technical Department and must provide all necessary supporting information including, where appropriate, clear evidence of failures. The FIA will circulate the correspondence to all Power Unit Manufacturers for comment. If the FIA is satisfied, in its absolute discretion, that these changes are acceptable, they will confirm to the Power Unit Manufacturer concerned that they may be carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n169\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cWherever practical, such requests must be submitted at least 14 days before the requested date of homologation.\\r\\nThe procedure and associated document templates that must be used by the Power Unit Manufacturers for their requests are available in the Appendix of the Regulations.\\r\\n5.2 Modifications can may be considered as minor if there is no or very limited effect on reliability and either the design of the part is not affected changed (e.g. change of supplier, change of part number ...etc) and if there is no or very limited effect on reliability (e.g. change of supplier, change of part number ...etc) or the geometrical change is minor, this attribute being subject to approval of the FIA at its sole discretion. These modifications must be clearly identified as minor in the requests, and they will be registered as such after approval by the other PU Manufacturers and the FIA. For such minor modifications, the PU Manufacturer may also request the possibility of exhausting the existing stock of parts alongside the use of the modified parts, and this must also be clearly specified in the request if applicable. In this case, there must be no preferential allocation of the modified parts between the Competitors supplied by the PU Manufacturer.\\r\\n5.3 An amendment to the published regulations that occurs after the start of the homologation may be used to modify components concerned by that amendment.\\r\\n5.4 Minimal incidental changes may be carried out for car installation purposes to the following components of the Power Unit:\\r\\na. Wirings\\r\\nb. Exhaust system, provided the key defining parameters of the system (diameters, lengths, etc.) remain fundamentally unchanged\\r\\nc. Turbo-compressor position (within 20mm from the original position in relation to the ICE), turbo clocking, turbo supports\\r\\nd. Position of the wastegates with housings and pipes\\r\\ne. Position of the pop-off valves with housings and pipes\\r\\nf. Air Inlet system as defined in row 44 of the first table of Appendix 3, provided the key defining parameters of the system (diameters, lengths, etc.) remain fundamentally unchanged\\r\\n5.5 Any permitted modifications concerning parts that are inside the sealed perimeter (i.e. parts described as \"INC\" in the \"Art. 5.23 Seal. Perim.\" column of Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations) can only be applied to new Power Unit elements, i.e. no element already used (Art. 28 of the Sporting Regulations) may be modified.\\r\\n5.6 Changes of fuel and oil suppliers will be accepted, provided such changes are intended for commercial and not for performance reasons.\\r\\n5.7 With reference to Article 40.3 of the Sporting Regulations, if a Power Unit part is subsequently replaced after qualifying practice by another which differs only by one or more modifications permitted by this Paragraph 5, the replacement Power Unit part will be considered the same in design and similar in mass, inertia and function.\\r\\n5.8 Requests for repair of a PU component in the form of a patch made of the same material or made of composite material, following damage or failure, may be accepted if it is only local and minimal. If accepted such repair can be applied to all components available but only on a temporary basis. It must not be present on the components used during the following Championship season if it is not made of the same material.\\r\\n6 Schedule for the introduction at Events of modified Power Unit parts\\r\\n6.1 The first time one or more Power Units comprising modified parts, as permitted by Paragraphs 4 and 5, are used in any of the cars powered by the Power Unit Manufacturer, a minimum of 1 Power Unit with the exact same specification must be available for each\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n170\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cCompetitor. Each Competitor will have priority use of one of these Power Units until the end of the first day of the Competition.\\r\\nIn the case of a Manufacturer supplying Power Units to more than 2 Competitors, one exception per Championship season can be granted by the FIA, in its absolute discretion, in the event of genuine supply issues. The request must be made in writing to the FIA Technical Department and must provide all necessary information and evidence of the supply issue. If the FIA is satisfied, the minimum required number of Power Units available for all Competitors may be reduced to 2 for the Event where the modified part is used for the first time.\\r\\n6.2 Any new Power Unit element used for the first time in an Event must always include all modifications included in any Power Unit element already used by any of the cars powered by the PU Manufacturer.\\r\\n6.3 The requirements of 6.1 and 6.2 don\\'t apply to minor modifications as defined in 5.2.\\r\\n6.4 A Power Unit element will be deemed to have been used once the car\\'s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.\\r\\n7 Conformity with the power unit homologation dossier\\r\\nAll Power Units must be delivered such that the seals required under Article 28.5 of the Sporting Regulations can be fitted.

Changes added at this issue are highlighted thus\\r\\n1 Changes for 2024\\r\\n9.7.2 Each Competitor must nominate the forward gear ratios (calculated from engine crankshaft to drive shafts) to be employed within their gearbox. These nominations must be declared to the FIA technical delegate at or before the first Competition of the Championship.\\r\\nIn the event the Competitor obtains the Gearbox from another Competitor as a TRC, the gear ratios used must be the same between those two Competitors unless the customer competitor opts to continue with the ratios used in the previous Championship Season.\\r\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, changes to the forward gear ratios under the provisions of this Article may involve changes to either the gear ratio pairs defined in Article 9.7.3, or to the final drive.\\r\\n\\r\\n10.8.4\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment of tyres\\r\\na. Tyres may only be inflated with air or nitrogen.\\r\\nb. Any process the intent of which is to reduce the amount of moisture in the tyre and/or in its inflation gas is forbidden.\\r\\nc. A complete wheel must contain a single fixed internal gas volume. No valves, bleeds or permeable membranes are permitted other than to inflate or deflate the tyre whilst the car is stationary.\\r\\nd. Tyre heating devices are prohibited. Any other device, system or procedure (except for driving of the car) the purpose and/or effect of which is to heat the wheels, hubs or brakes above the ambient air temperature, or to maintain their temperature if they are already warm, is prohibited.\\r\\n\\r\\n12.4.1 Principal Roll Structure\\r\\nThe principal roll structure must satisfy the following geometric requirements:\\r\\na. It must have structure at [XC=55, 0, 968].\\r\\nb. A horizontal section through the structure at Z=950 must enclose an area of at least Have a minimum enclosed structural cross section of 6000mm\\xef\\xbf\\xbd., in vertical projection, across a horizontal plane at Z=950. The cross-sectional area may not be less than 6000mm2 in any horizontal section below this plane.\\r\\nc. Above Z=935, have the external surface of the structure must be that is tangent continuous, and does must not contain any concave radius of curvature. Any convex radius of curvature must be no smaller than 20mm.\\r\\nCompliance will be assessed without considering an opening in the structure to allow aerodynamic ducts to pass through. Any such opening must be below Z=955\\r\\nMinimal local deviations from this surface are permitted where the load pad described in Article 13.3.1 contacts the structure, at the intersection of the external surface and openings for an internal duct, and for the mounting of Camera 4.\\r\\nd. A horizontal section through the structure at Z=910 must enclose an area of at least Have a minimum enclosed structural cross section of 10000mm\\xef\\xbf\\xbd, in vertical projection, across a horizontal plane at Z=910. The area thus established must not exceed 200mm in length or width and may not be less than 10000mm2 below this point. Furthermore, the section must enclose an axis-aligned square of side 70mm. These requirements must be maintained in any horizontal section below this plane.\\r\\n\\r\\n2023 Formula 1 Technical Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n181\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n07 December 2022 Issue 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cWhen evaluating the above, only parts that genuinely contribute to the strength of the principal roll structure will be considered and no fairings may be included. Parts of the structure above Z=935 must be designed to support the car in a 15g vertical impact with the ground and be made from an abrasion resistant material.\\r\\nThe areas required in (b) and (d) above, will be taken as the area of the minimum convex polygon enclosing the structural parts of the roll hoop in that plane.\\r\\nIn order that a car may be lifted quickly in the event of it stopping on the circuit, the principal rollover structure must incorporate an unobstructed opening, whose section measures 60mm x 30mm with internal radii of no more than R15mm, clearly visible in side view, to permit a strap to pass through it.\\r\\nIt must be shown by calculation that this opening is capable of resisting a load of 20kN applied by a strap in an upwards direction, on the ZX plane between +45\\xef\\xbf\\xbd and -45\\xef\\xbf\\xbd to the Z-axis. In designs where the strap could be threaded in different ways, calculations must be provided for all possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n13.3 Roll Structure Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n13.3.1\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal roll structure must be subjected to one of the following static tests at 75% of the load (105kN), followed by one of the tests at full load (140kN). Both tests must be carried out on the same structure. The tests will be chosen at random and communicated to the Competitor 3 weeks before their scheduled homologation date.\\r\\n\\r\\na. A load of [81, 81, -80]kN\\r\\n\\r\\nb. A load of [-81, 81, -80]kN\\r\\n\\r\\nc. A load of [0, 0, -140]kN\\r\\n\\r\\na. A load equivalent to 60kN laterally, 70kN longitudinally in a rearward direction and 105kN vertically downwards, must be applied to the top of the structure through a rigid flat pad which is 200mm in diameter and perpendicular to the loading axis.\\r\\n\\r\\nb. A load equivalent to 42kN laterally, 49kN longitudinally in a forward direction and 73.5kN vertically downwards, must be applied to the top of the structure through a rigid flat pad which is 200mm in diameter and perpendicular to the loading axis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each test:\\r\\n\\r\\ni. Initially, the pad must not contact the roll structure below Z=935.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. At any time during the test, the pad must not contact the structure below Z=900.\\r\\n\\r\\niii. Rubber 3mm thick may be used between the load pads and the roll structure.\\r\\n\\r\\niv. The peak load must be applied in less than three minutes and be maintained for 10 seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nv. Under the load, deformation must be less than 25mm when measured along the loading axis and any structural failure limited to 100mm below the top of the roll structure when measured vertically.\\r\\n\\r\\nvi. During the test, the roll structure must be attached to the survival cell which is supported on its underside on a flat plate, fixed to it through its engine mounting points and wedged laterally by any of the static load test pads described in Article 13.4.2.\\r\\n\\r\\nvii. The load must be applied to the structure through a rigid flat pad which is 200mm in diameter and perpendicular to the loading axis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore performing the physical tests specified above, the Competitor must submit detailed calculations to show that the principle roll structure and survival cell are able to sustain the 3 loads above and following loads:\\r\\n\\r\\nd.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES\\r\\n\\r\\nScope\\r\\n1.1 These Power Unit Financial Regulations come into force on 1 January 2023. They form part of the terms and conditions for the homologation of Power Units to be supplied to F1 Teams for participation in the Championship from 2026 onwards. Each Power Unit Manufacturer intending to homologate Power Units for supply to an F1 Team(s) for participation in the Championship from 2026 onwards agrees to be bound by, and undertakes to comply with, these Power Unit Financial Regulations from the start of its N-3 Full Year Reporting Period.\\r\\n\\r\\nObjectives\\r\\n\\r\\n1.2 These Power Unit Financial Regulations introduce a Power Unit Cost Cap that limits certain costs that may be incurred by or on behalf of a Power Unit Manufacturer in each Full Year Reporting Period, while leaving that Power Unit Manufacturer free to decide how to allocate resources within that Power Unit Cost Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3 These Power Unit Financial Regulations are designed to help achieve the following objectives (the \"Objectives\"):\\r\\n(a) to promote the long-term competitive balance of the Championship in respect of Power Units;\\r\\n(b) to promote the long-term sporting fairness of the Championship in respect of Power Units; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) to ensure the long-term financial stability and sustainability of the Power Unit Manufacturers,\\r\\nwhile preserving the unique technology and engineering challenge of Formula 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4 These Power Unit Financial Regulations will be interpreted and applied by the Cost Cap Administration, the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel and the ICA in a consistent manner that treats all Power Unit Manufacturers equally and that advances the Objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5 The definitive version of these Power Unit Financial Regulations is the English version, which will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Defined words and phrases in these Power Unit Financial Regulations (denoted by initial capital letters) have the meaning indicated in Appendix 1 to these Power Unit Financial Regulations, unless otherwise defined in the body of these Power Unit Financial Regulations. Unless otherwise specified, references to \"Articles\" are to Articles of these Power Unit Financial Regulations, references to \"may\" shall mean in the sole discretion of such person or entity (as the context so requires), and any phrase introduced by the terms \"including\", \"include\", \"in particular\" or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and not as limiting the sense of the words preceding those terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.6 If any part of these Power Unit Financial Regulations is found by a court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that part will be deemed not to form part of these Power Unit Financial Regulations, and the legality, validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Power Unit Financial Regulations will not be affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 1 Power Unit Financial Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n16 August 2022 Issue 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c1.7 The Cost Cap Administration shall periodically review these Power Unit Financial Regulations.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES\\r\\n\\r\\nScope\\r\\n1.1 These Financial Regulations came into force on 1 January 2021. They form part of the terms and conditions of participation in the Championship. Each F1 Team participating in the Championship agrees to be bound by and undertakes to comply with these Financial Regulations.\\r\\nObjectives\\r\\n\\r\\n1.2 These Financial Regulations define a Cost Cap that limits certain costs that may be incurred by or on behalf of an F1 Team in each Full Year Reporting Period, while leaving that F1 Team free to decide how to allocate resources within that Cost Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3 These Financial Regulations are designed to achieve the following objectives (the \"Objectives\"):\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) to promote the competitive balance of the Championship;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) to promote the sporting fairness of the Championship; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) to ensure the long-term financial stability and sustainability of the F1 Teams, while preserving the unique technology and engineering challenge of Formula 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4 These Financial Regulations will be interpreted and applied by the Cost Cap Administration, the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel and the ICA in a consistent manner that treats all F1 Teams equally and that achieves the Objectives.\\r\\n1.5 The definitive version of these Financial Regulations is the English version, which will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Defined words and phrases in these Financial Regulations (denoted by initial capital letters) have the meaning indicated in the Appendix to these Financial Regulations, unless otherwise defined in the body of these Financial Regulations. Unless otherwise specified, references to \"Articles\" are to Articles of these Financial Regulations, references to \"may\" shall mean in the sole discretion of such person or entity (as the context so requires), and any phrase introduced by the terms \"including\", \"include\", \"in particular\" or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and not as limiting the sense of the words preceding those terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.6 If any part of these Financial Regulations is found by a court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that part will be deemed not to form part of these Financial Regulations, and the legality, validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Financial Regulations will not be affected.\\r\\n1.7 The Cost Cap Administration shall periodically review these Financial Regulations. These Financial Regulations may be amended and/or supplemented by the FIA World Motor Sport Council from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccountability\\r\\n\\r\\n1.8 Each F1 Team must ensure that all Personnel are made aware:\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 1 Financial Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n8 December 2022 Issue 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c(a) of the Objectives, content and substance of these Financial Regulations; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) that the F1 Team is subject to these Financial Regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.9 Each F1 Team must ensure that all relevant Personnel are appropriately informed and trained with respect to the ways in which their areas of responsibility may impact the F1 Team\\'s compliance with these Financial Regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.10 Each F1 Team must ensure that the FIA ethics and compliance policy in force from time to time with respect to these Financial Regulations is clearly communicated to all Personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. F1 TEAM OBLIGATIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1 Each F1 Team must:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) demonstrate its ongoing compliance with the Cost Cap by submitting Reporting Documentation in respect of its Reporting Group to the Cost Cap Administration by the Reporting Deadline in respect of each Reporting Period and by providing any further information requested from time to time by the Cost Cap Administration;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) cooperate fully and in a timely manner with the Cost Cap Administration in the exercise of its regulatory function, including any investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Cost Cap Administration pursuant to these Financial Regulations;\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) provide any information and documentation requested by or on behalf of the Cost Cap Administration relevant to any actual, potential or suspected instance of noncompliance with these Financial Regulations; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) faithfully execute its obligations under these Financial Regulations and act at all times in a spirit of Good Faith and cooperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCap on Relevant Costs\\r\\n\\r\\n2.2 An F1 Team must:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) determine and report its Relevant Costs against the Cost Cap in the F1 Team\\'s Presentation Currency; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) not have Relevant Costs in excess of the Cost Cap in the applicable Full Year Reporting Period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cost Cap\\r\\n\\r\\n2.3 The amount of the \"Cost Cap\" shall be as follows, in each case adjusted (if applicable) for Indexation:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) in the Full Year Reporting Period ending on 31 December 2022:\\r\\n\\r\\n(i) in the event that 21 Competitions take place in that Full Year Reporting Period, US Dollars 140,000,000; or\\r\\n\\r\\n(ii) in the event that fewer than 21 Competitions take place in that Full Year Reporting Period, US Dollars 140,000,000, decreased by an amount equivalent\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 1 Financial Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n8 December 2022 Issue 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cto US Dollars 1,200,000 multiplied by \"X\", where \"X\" is equal to 21 minus the number of Competitions taking place in that Full Year Reporting Period; or\\r\\n\\r\\n(iii) in the event that more than 21 Competitions take place in that Full Year Reporting Period, US Dollars 140,000,000, increased by an amount equivalent to US Dollars 1,200,000 multiplied by \"X\", where \"X\" is equal to the number of Competitions taking place in that Full Year Reporting Period minus 21;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) in the Full Year Reporting Period ending on 31 December 2023 and in each subsequent Full Year Reporting Period:\\r\\n\\r\\n(i) in the event that 21 Competitions take place in that Full Year Reporting Period, US Dollars 135,000,000; or\\r\\n\\r\\n(ii) in the event that fewer than 21 Competitions take place in that Full Year Reporting Period, US Dollars 135,000,000, decreased by an amount equivalent to US Dollars 1,200,000 multiplied by \"X\", where \"X\" is equal to 21 minus the number of Competitions taking place in that Full Year Reporting Period; or\\r\\n\\r\\n(iii) in the event that more than 21 Competitions take place in that Full Year Reporting Period, US Dollars 135,000,000, increased by an amount equivalent to US Dollars 1,200,000 multiplied by \"X\", where \"X\" is equal to the number of Competitions taking place in that Full Year Reporting Period minus 21;\\r\\n\\r\\nprovided that if any Competition in a Full Year Reporting Period is cancelled less than three months prior to the proposed start date of that Competition (or, where applicable, any rescheduled date), such Competition shall be deemed to have taken place in the applicable Full Year Reporting Period for the purposes of Articles 2.3(a) to 2.3(c).\\r\\n\\r\\n2.4 Where an F1 Team has a Presentation Currency other than US Dollars, the Cost Cap for that F1 Team shall be converted from US Dollars into that F1 Team\\'s Presentation Currency at the Initial Applicable Rate. For illustrative purposes, the amount of the Cost Cap in selected Presentation Currencies for the Full Year Reporting Period ending on 31 December 2022, as referred to in Article 2.3(a) (assuming 21 Competitions and Indexation of zero) is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nUS Dollars (`000)\\r\\n140,000\\r\\n\\r\\nPresentation Currency\\r\\n\\r\\nPounds Sterling\\r\\n\\r\\nEuros\\r\\n\\r\\n(`000)\\r\\n\\r\\n(`000)\\r\\n\\r\\n110,314\\r\\n\\r\\n127,481\\r\\n\\r\\nSwiss Francs (`000)\\r\\n139,442\\r\\n\\r\\nReporting Group\\r\\n2.5 For the purposes of reporting Total Costs of the Reporting Group, an F1 Team\\'s Reporting Group shall comprise the F1 Team together with, where the F1 Team has incurred less than 95% of the costs of the F1 Activities undertaken by or on behalf of the F1 Team in the Reporting Period, such additional entities within the F1 Team\\'s Legal Group Structure as are determined in accordance with Article 2.6.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 1 Financial Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n8 December 2022 Issue 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0c2.6 The additional entities to be included within the Reporting Group where an F1 Team has incurred less than 95% of the costs of the F1 Activities undertaken by or on behalf of that F1 Team in the Reporting Period shall be the entity (other than the F1 Team) within the F1 Team\\'s Legal Group Structure that incurred the greatest amount of costs of the F1 Activities undertaken by or on behalf of the F1 Team in the Reporting Period, followed (to the extent required) by the entity within the F1 Team\\'s Legal Group Structure that incurred the next greatest amount of such costs, and so on, until the entities included within the Reporting Group have incurred, in aggregate, 95% or more of the costs of the F1 Activities undertaken by or on behalf of the F1 Team in the Reporting Period.\\r\\n2.7 In addition to those entities included in the Reporting Group pursuant to Articles 2.5 and 2.6, an F1 Team may elect to include additional entities in its Reporting Group from within its Legal Group Structure which have incurred costs of F1 Activities undertaken on behalf of the F1 Team in the Reporting Period.\\r\\n2.8 For the purposes of Articles 2.5 to 2.7 (inclusive), the calculation of the costs of F1 Activities undertaken by or on behalf of the F1 Team in the Reporting Period:\\r\\n(a) shall not include Finance Costs and costs Directly Attributable to Marketing Activities;\\r\\n(b) shall be made having adjusted out any amounts in connection with F1 Activities recharged from one member of the F1 Team\\'s Legal Group Structure to another.\\r\\n2.9 No entity shall be included in the Reporting Group of more than one F1 Team. If, but for the provisions of this Article 2.9, an entity would be included in the Reporting Group of more than one F1 Team pursuant to the provisions of Articles 2.5 to 2.8 (inclusive), then that entity shall only be included in the Reporting Group of the F1 Team in respect of which it incurs the greatest amount of costs of F1 Activities, excluding Finance Costs and costs Directly Attributable to Marketing Activities.\\r\\n2.10 In the calculation of Relevant Costs, the costs of any F1 Activities incurred by entities within the F1 Team\\'s Legal Group Structure but outside its Reporting Group, other than Finance Costs and costs Directly Attributable to Marketing Activities undertaken by any such entity, must either be:\\r\\n(a) recharged at Fair Value to a Reporting Group Entity and thereby included within Total Costs of the Reporting Group; or\\r\\n(b) included in Relevant Costs at Fair Value by way of an Adjustment to Total Costs of the Reporting Group, as a Related Party Transaction pursuant to Article 4.1(a)(i).\\r\\n2.11 The F1 Team should seek clarification from the Cost Cap Administration if it is uncertain whether an entity should be included in its Reporting Group.\\r\\n3.

The President of the Hearing will be responsible for the conduct of the proceedings, verifying the regularity of the proceedings, ensuring that the rights of the Parties are respected (including their right to confidentiality at the hearing), keeping order during the hearing, and arranging for the drafting of the decision, (which shall be authenticated by his/her signature) as well as his/her notification to the FIA and the Respondent and its publication.\\r\\n\\r\\n7.13 Those present at each hearing may include (together the \"Parties\" and each a \"Party\"):\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the parties to the proceedings, namely the FIA (as the body responsible for enforcement of these Financial Regulations) and the relevant F1 Team (as the \"Respondent\");\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) the representatives of the FIA and the Respondent;\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any Witnesses, as permitted under Articles 7.15 and 7.18; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) any third party observer(s), as permitted under Article 7.17.\\r\\n\\r\\n7.14 The Cost Cap Adjudication Panel will make public its decision to conduct the hearing, and will publish the final decision of the judging panel resolving the proceedings in accordance with Article 7.27, but otherwise the proceedings before the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel will be confidential and no Party may disclose any facts or other information (including Confidential Information) relating to the proceedings either before, during or after the proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\n7.15 The FIA and the Respondent may submit written evidence from their respective Witness(es) to the President of the Hearing within the prescribed timeframes. If the President of the Hearing considers the evidence to be relevant, he may invite such Witness(es) to attend the hearing in order to answer any questions from the President of the Hearing, and/or the\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula 1 Financial Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\n21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd 2022 F\\xef\\xbf\\xbdd\\xef\\xbf\\xbdration Internationale de l\\'Automobile\\r\\n\\r\\n8 December 2022 Issue 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x0cjudging panel, and/or the FIA and/or the Respondent.

If permission is granted, the third party shall attend the hearing in an observer capacity only. The third party shall not be permitted to make submissions, to present evidence, or to question Witnesses.\\r\\n7.18 The President of the Hearing may decide, if he considers that fairness to the FIA or the Respondent requires it, or that it would assist the judging panel, to hear from any other Witness, in addition to the FIA, the Respondent and each of their Witnesses.\\r\\n7.19 After they have made their statements, the President of the Hearing may direct any Witness to remain in the courtroom and not to speak to any other Witness.\\r\\n7.20 The President of the Hearing will then invite each of the FIA and the Respondent to make their closing statements.\\r\\n7.21 The President of the Hearing may permit a Party to attend via videoconference or other means of communication.\\r\\n7.22 At any point during the hearing, the judging panel may decide, after hearing the Parties but before making a final decision:\\r\\n(a) to request further information; or\\r\\n(b) to postpone proceedings to a later hearing, in particular in order to hear Witnesses.\\r\\n7.23 After the Respondent has had the last word, the hearing will be declared closed and no further submissions or evidence shall be permitted, unless requested by the judging panel after a hearing has been re-opened.\\r\\n7.24 After the close of the hearing, the President of the Hearing will announce the likely time and date when the decision will be pronounced.\\r\\n7.25 The judging panel may decide to re-open the hearing at any point in its deliberation, for instance if it becomes aware of any new fact.
